R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nV. PROSECUTION AND DECLINATION DECISIONS \nThe Appointment Order authorized the Special Counsel\u2019s Office \u201cto prosecute federal \ncrimes arising from [its] investigation\u201d of the matters assigned to it.  In deciding whether to  \nexercise this prosecutorial authority, the Office has been guided by the Principles of Federal \nProsecution set forth in the Justice (formerly U.S. Attorney\u2019s) Manual. In particular, the Office \nhas evaluated whether the conduct of the individuals considered for prosecution constituted a \nfederal offense and whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain \na conviction for such an offense. Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220 (2018). Where the answer to those \nquestions was yes, the Office further considered whether the prosecution would serve a substantial \nfederal interest, the individuals were subject to effective prosecution in another jurisdiction, and \nthere existed an adequate non-criminal alternative to prosecution.  Id. \nAs explained below, those considerations led the Office to seek charges against two sets of \nRussian nationals for their roles in perpetrating the active-measures social media campaign and \ncomputer-intrusion operations.   Investigative Technique\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\n  The Office \nsimilarly determined that the contacts  between Campaign officials and Russia-linked individuals  \neither did not involve the commission of a federal crime or, in the case of campaign-finance \noffenses, that our evidence was not sufficient to obtain and sustain a criminal conviction. At the \nsame time, the Office concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution supported charging \ncertain individuals connected to the Campaign with making false statements or otherwise \nobstructing this investigation or parallel congressional investigations.   \nA. Russian \u201cActive Measures\u201d Social Media Campaign \nOn February 16, 2018, a federal grand jury in the District of Columbia returned an \nindictment charging 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities\u2014including the Internet \nResearch Agency (IRA) and Concord Management and Consulting LLC (Concord)\u2014with \nviolating U.S. criminal laws in order to interfere with U.S. elections and political processes.1276 \nThe indictment charges all of the defendants with conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count \nOne), three defendants with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud (Count Two), and \nfive defendants with aggravated identity theft (Counts Three through Eight). Internet Research \nAgency Indictment. Concord, which is one of the entities charged in the Count One conspiracy, \nentered an appearance through U.S. counsel and moved to dismiss the charge on multiple grounds.  \nIn orders and memorandum opinions issued on August 13 and November 15, 2018, the district \ncourt denied Concord\u2019s motions to dismiss. United States v. Concord Management & Consulting \nLLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38 (D.D.C. 2018). United States v. Concord Management & Consulting \nLLC, 317 F. Supp. 3d 598 (D.D.C. 2018). As of this writing, the prosecution of Concord remains \nongoing before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  The other defendants remain \nat large. \n1276 A more detailed explanation of the charging decision in this case is set forth in a separate \nmemorandum provided to the Acting Attorney General before the indictment.   \n174 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAlthough members of the IRA had contact with individuals affiliated with the Trump \nCampaign, the indictment does not charge any Trump Campaign official or any other U.S. person \nwith participating in the conspiracy. That is because the investigation did not identify evidence \nthat any U.S. person who coordinated or communicated with the IRA knew that he or she was \nspeaking with Russian nationals engaged in the criminal conspiracy. The Office therefore \ndetermined that such persons did not have the knowledge or criminal purpose required to charge \nthem in the conspiracy to defraud the United States (Count One) or in the separate count alleging \na wire- and bank-fraud conspiracy involving the IRA and two individual Russian nationals (Count \nTwo). \nThe Office did, however, charge one U.S. national for his role in supplying false or stolen \nbank account numbers that allowed the IRA conspirators to access U.S. online payment systems \nby circumventing those systems\u2019 security features. On February 12, 2018, Richard Pinedo pleaded \nguilty, pursuant to a single-count information, to identity fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1028(a)(7) and (b)(1)(D). Plea Agreement, United States v. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 12, 2018), Doc. 10. The investigation did not establish that Pinedo was aware of the \nidentity of the IRA members who purchased bank account numbers from him. Pinedo\u2019s sales of \naccount numbers enabled the IRA members to anonymously access a financial network through \nwhich they transacted with U.S. persons and companies. See Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 3, United States \nv. Richard Pinedo, No. 1:18-cr-24 (D.D.C. Sept. 26, 2018), Doc. 24. On October 10, 2018, Pinedo \nwas sentenced to six months of imprisonment, to be followed by six months of home confinement, \nand was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service. \nB.

The statutes comprising the NSPA cover \n\u201cgoods, wares, or merchandise,\u201d and lower courts have largely understood that phrase to be limited to \ntangible items since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985). See \nUnited States v. Yijia Zhang, 995 F. Supp. 2d 340, 344-48 (E.D. Pa. 2014) (collecting cases).  One of those \npost-Dowling decisions\u2014United States v. Brown, 925 F.2d 1301 (10th Cir. 1991)\u2014specifically held that \nthe NSPA does not reach \u201ca computer program in source code form,\u201d even though that code was stored in \ntangible items (i.e., a hard disk and in a three-ring notebook). Id. at 1302-03. Congress, in turn, cited the \nBrown opinion in explaining the need for amendments to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(2) that \u201cwould ensure that \nthe theft of intangible information by the unauthorized use of a computer is prohibited in the same way theft \nof physical items [is] protected.\u201d S. Rep. 104-357, at 7 (1996). That sequence of events would make it \ndifficult to argue that hacked emails in electronic form, which are the relevant stolen items here, constitute \n\u201cgoods, wares, or merchandise\u201d within the meaning of the NSPA. \n176 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nPersonal Privacy\nC. Russian Government Outreach and Contacts \nAs explained in Section IV above, the Office\u2019s investigation uncovered evidence of \nnumerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or \nclaiming to have ties to the Russian government.  The Office evaluated the contacts under several \nsets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate \nin the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges \nunder these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above\u2014with the \nexception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on \nbehalf of Ukraine. \nOne of the interactions between the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals\u2014 \nthe June 9, 2016 meeting between high-ranking campaign officials and Russians promising \nderogatory information on Hillary Clinton\u2014implicates an additional body of law: campaign-\nfinance statutes. Schemes involving the solicitation or receipt of assistance from foreign sources \nraise difficult statutory and constitutional questions.  As explained  below, the Office evaluated  \nthose questions in connection with the June 9 meetingHarm to Ongoing Matter\n \n. \nThe Office ultimately concluded that, even if  the principal legal questions were resolved favorably \nto the government, a prosecution would encounter difficulties proving that Campaign officials or \nInvestigative Technique\nindividuals connected to the Campaign willfully violated the law.    \nFinally, although the evidence of contacts between Campaign officials and Russia-\naffiliated individuals may not have been sufficient to establish or sustain criminal charges, several \nU.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other \nsteps to obstruct the Office\u2019s investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore \ncharged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.   \n1. Potential Coordination: Conspiracy and Collusion \nAs an initial matter, this Office evaluated potentially criminal conduct that involved the \ncollective action of multiple individuals not under the rubric of \u201ccollusion,\u201d but through the lens \nof conspiracy law. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word \u201ccollud[e]\u201d appears in the \nActing Attorney General\u2019s August 2, 2017 memorandum; it has frequently been invoked in public \nreporting; and it is sometimes referenced in antitrust law, see, e.g., Brooke Group v. Brown & \nWilliamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993). But collusion is not a specific offense or \ntheory of liability found in the U.S. Code; nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.  To the \ncontrary, even as defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as \nthat crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371.  See Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 321 (10th ed. 2014) (collusion is \u201c[a]n agreement to defraud another or to do or obtain \nsomething forbidden by law\u201d); 1 Alexander Burrill, A Law Dictionary and Glossary 311 (1871) \n(\u201cAn agreement between two or more persons to defraud another by the forms of law, or to employ \nsuch forms as means of accomplishing some unlawful object.\u201d); 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary 352 \n180 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n(1897) (\u201cAn agreement between two or more persons to defraud a person of his rights by the forms \nof law, or to obtain an object forbidden by law.\u201d).     \nFor that reason, this Office\u2019s focus in resolving the question of joint criminal liability was \non conspiracy as defined in federal law, not the commonly discussed term \u201ccollusion.\u201d The Office \nconsidered in particular whether contacts between Trump Campaign officials and Russia-linked \nindividuals could trigger liability for the crime of conspiracy\u2014either under statutes that have their \nown conspiracy language (e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1349, 1951(a)), or under the general conspiracy \nstatute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371). The investigation did not establish that the contacts described in Volume \nI, Section IV, supra, amounted to an agreement to commit any substantive violation of federal \ncriminal law\u2014including foreign-influence and campaign-finance laws, both of which are \ndiscussed further below. The Office therefore did not charge any individual associated with the \nTrump Campaign with conspiracy to commit a federal offense arising from Russia contacts, either \nunder a specific statute or under Section 371\u2019s offenses clause.  \nThe Office also did not charge any campaign official or associate with a conspiracy under \nSection 371\u2019s defraud clause. That clause criminalizes participating in an agreement to obstruct a \nlawful function of the U.S. government or its agencies through deceitful or dishonest means. See \nDennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 861 (1966); Hammerschmidt v. United States, 265 U.S. \n182, 188 (1924); see also United States v. Concord Mgmt. & Consulting LLC, 347 F. Supp. 3d 38, \n46 (D.D.C. 2018). The investigation did not establish any agreement among Campaign officials\u2014 \nor between such officials and Russia-linked individuals\u2014to interfere with or obstruct a lawful \nfunction of a government agency during the campaign or transition period. And, as discussed in \nVolume I, Section V.A, supra, the investigation did not identify evidence that any Campaign \nofficial or associate knowingly and intentionally participated in the conspiracy to defraud that the \nOffice charged, namely, the active-measures conspiracy described in Volume I, Section II, supra. \nAccordingly, the Office did not charge any Campaign associate or other U.S. person with \nconspiracy to defraud the United States based on the Russia-related contacts described in Section \nIV above. \n2. Potential Coordination: Foreign Agent Statutes (FARA and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951) \nThe Office next assessed the potential liability of Campaign-affiliated individuals under \nfederal statutes regulating actions on behalf of, or work done for, a foreign government.   \na. Governing Law \nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951, it is generally illegal to act in the United States as an agent of a \nforeign government without providing notice to the Attorney General. Although the defendant \nmust act on behalf of a foreign government (as opposed to other kinds of foreign entities), the acts \nneed not involve espionage; rather, acts of any type suffice for liability. See United States v. \nDuran, 596 F.3d 1283, 1293-94 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.3d 709, 715 (7th \nCir. 2009); United States v. Dumeisi, 424 F.3d 566, 581 (7th Cir. 2005). An \u201cagent of a foreign \ngovernment\u201d is an \u201cindividual\u201d who \u201cagrees to operate\u201d in the United States \u201csubject to the \ndirection or control of a foreign government or official.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951(d). \n181 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nThe crime defined by Section 951 is complete upon knowingly acting in the United States \nas an unregistered foreign-government agent. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 951(a). The statute does not require \nwillfulness, and knowledge of the notification requirement is not an element of the offense. United \nStates v.

The triggering agency \nrelationship must be with a foreign principal or \u201ca person any of whose activities are directly or \nindirectly supervised, directed, controlled, financed, or subsidized in whole or in major part by a \nforeign principal.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(c)(1). That includes a foreign government or political party \nand various foreign individuals and entities.  22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(b).  A covered relationship exists if \na person \u201cacts as an agent, representative, employee, or servant\u201d or \u201cin any other capacity at the \norder, request, or under the [foreign principal\u2019s] direction or control.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(c)(1). It \nis sufficient if the person \u201cagrees, consents, assumes or purports to act as, or who is or holds \nhimself out to be, whether or not pursuant to contractual relationship, an agent of a foreign \nprincipal.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(c)(2). \nThe triggering activity is that the agent \u201cdirectly or through any other person\u201d in the United \nStates (1) engages in \u201cpolitical activities for or in the interests of [the] foreign principal,\u201d which \nincludes attempts to influence federal officials or the public; (2) acts as \u201cpublic relations counsel, \npublicity agent, information-service employee or political consultant for or in the interests of such \nforeign principal\u201d; (3) \u201csolicits, collects, disburses, or dispenses contributions, loans, money, or \nother things of value for or in the interest of such foreign principal\u201d; or (4) \u201crepresents the interests \nof such foreign principal\u201d before any federal agency or official.  22 U.S.C. \u00a7 611(c)(1). \nIt is a crime to engage in a \u201c[w]illful violation of any provision of the Act or any regulation \nthereunder.\u201d 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 618(a)(1). It is also a crime willfully to make false statements or \nomissions of material facts in FARA registration statements or supplements. \n22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 618(a)(2).

Those potential violations, however, concerned a country other than Russia (i.e., Turkey) \nand were resolved when Flynn admitted to the underlying facts in the Statement of Offense that \naccompanied his guilty plea to a false-statements charge. Statement of Offense, United States v. \nMichael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 4 (\u201cFlynn Statement of \nOffense\u201d).1281 \nThe investigation did not, however, yield evidence sufficient to sustain any charge that any \nindividual affiliated with the Trump Campaign acted as an agent of a foreign principal within the \nmeaning of FARA or, in terms of Section 951, subject to the direction or control of the government \nof Russia, or any official thereof. In particular, the Office did not find evidence likely to prove \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Campaign officials such as Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos, \nand Carter Page acted as agents of the Russian government\u2014or at its direction, control, or \nrequest\u2014during the relevant time period.1282  Personal Privacy\n \nAs a result, the Office did not charge PP\n \nany other Trump Campaign official with violating \nFARA or Section 951, or attempting or conspiring to do so, based on contacts with the Russian \ngovernment or a Russian principal. \nFinally, the Office investigated whether one of the above campaign advisors\u2014George \nPapadopoulos\u2014acted as an agent of, or at the direction and control of, the government of Israel.  \nWhile the investigation revealed significant ties between Papadopoulos and Israel (and search \nwarrants were obtained in part on that basis), the Office ultimately determined that the evidence \nwas not sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction under FARA or Section 951.    \n3. Campaign Finance \nSeveral areas of the Office\u2019s investigation involved efforts or offers by foreign nationals to \nprovide negative information about candidate Clinton to the Trump Campaign or to distribute that \ninformation to the public, to the anticipated benefit of the Campaign.

To that end, federal campaign-\nfinance law broadly prohibits foreign nationals from making contributions, donations, \nexpenditures, or other disbursements in connection with federal, state, or local candidate elections, \nand prohibits anyone from soliciting, accepting, or receiving such contributions or donations.  As \nrelevant here, foreign nationals may not make\u2014and no one may \u201csolicit, accept, or receive\u201d from \nthem\u2014\u201ca contribution or donation of money or other thing of value\u201d or \u201can express or implied \npromise to make a contribution or donation, in connection with a Federal, State, or local election.\u201d  \n52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).1283 The term \u201ccontribution,\u201d which is used throughout the \ncampaign-finance law, \u201cincludes\u201d \u201cany gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or \nanything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal \noffice.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, \u201cthe value of [volunteer] \nservices.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(B)(i). \nForeign nationals are also barred from making \u201can expenditure, independent expenditure, \nor disbursement for an electioneering communication.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(1)(C). The term \n\u201cexpenditure\u201d \u201cincludes\u201d \u201cany purchase, payment, distribution, loan, advance, deposit, or gift of \nmoney or anything of value, made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for \nFederal office.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(9)(A)(i). It excludes, among other things, news stories and \nnon-partisan get-out-the-vote activities. \n52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(9)(B)(i)-(ii). \nAn \u201cindependent \nexpenditure\u201d is an expenditure \u201cexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified \ncandidate\u201d and made independently of the campaign. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(17). An \u201celectioneering \ncommunication\u201d is a broadcast communication that \u201crefers to a clearly identified candidate for \nFederal office\u201d and is made within specified time periods and targeted at the relevant electorate.  \n52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104(f)(3). \nThe statute defines \u201cforeign national\u201d by reference to FARA and the Immigration and \nNationality Act, with minor modification. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(b) (cross-referencing 22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 611(b)(1)-(3) and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(20), (22)). That definition yields five, sometimes-\noverlapping categories of foreign nationals, which include all of the individuals and entities \nrelevant for present purposes\u2014namely, foreign governments and political parties, individuals \n1283 Campaign-finance law also places financial limits on contributions, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116(a), and \nprohibits contributions from corporations, banks, and labor unions, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30118(a); see Citizens \nUnited v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 320 (2010). Because the conduct that the Office investigated involved \npossible electoral activity by foreign nationals, the foreign-contributions ban is the most readily applicable \nprovision. \n184 \n",

Application to June 9 Trump Tower Meeting \nThe Office considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in \nconnection with the June 9 meeting described in Volume I, Section IV.A.5, supra. The Office \nconcluded that, in light of the government\u2019s substantial burden of proof on issues of intent \n(\u201cknowing\u201d and \u201cwillful\u201d), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, \ncriminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that \u201cthe admissible evidence will \nprobably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.\u201d  Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220.  \nIn brief, the key facts are that, on June 3, 2016, Robert Goldstone emailed Donald Trump \nJr., to pass along from Emin and Aras Agalarov an \u201coffer\u201d from Russia\u2019s \u201cCrown prosecutor\u201d to \n\u201cthe Trump campaign\u201d of \u201cofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and \nher dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u2019s] father.\u201d The email described \nthis as \u201cvery high level and sensitive information\u201d that is \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s \nsupport to Mr. Trump-helped along by Aras and Emin.\u201d Trump Jr. responded: \u201cif it\u2019s what you \nsay  I  love it  especially later in  the  summer.\u201d  Trump Jr. and  Emin Agalarov had follow-up \nconversations and, within days, scheduled a meeting with Russian representatives that was \nattended by Trump Jr., Manafort, and Kushner. The communications setting up the meeting and \nthe attendance by high-level Campaign representatives support an inference that the Campaign \nanticipated receiving derogatory documents and information from official Russian sources that \ncould assist candidate Trump\u2019s electoral prospects.   \nThis series of events could implicate the federal election-law ban on contributions and \ndonations by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(1)(A). Specifically, Goldstone passed along \nan offer purportedly from a Russian government official to provide \u201cofficial documents and \ninformation\u201d to the Trump Campaign for the purposes of influencing the presidential election. \nTrump Jr. appears to have accepted that offer and to have arranged a meeting to receive those \nmaterials. Documentary evidence in the form of email chains supports the inference that Kushner \nand Manafort were aware of that purpose and attended the June 9 meeting anticipating the receipt \nof helpful information to the Campaign from Russian sources.   \nThe Office considered whether this evidence would establish a conspiracy to violate the \nforeign contributions ban, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; the solicitation of an illegal foreign-\nsource contribution; or the acceptance or receipt of \u201can express or implied promise to make a \n185 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n[foreign-source] contribution,\u201d both in violation of 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2).  There are \nreasonable arguments that the offered information would constitute a \u201cthing of value\u201d within the \nmeaning of these provisions, but the Office determined that the government would not be likely to \nobtain and sustain a conviction for two other reasons: first, the Office did not obtain admissible \nevidence likely to meet the government\u2019s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these \nindividuals acted \u201cwillfully,\u201d i.e., with general knowledge of the illegality of their conduct; and, \nsecond, the government would likely encounter difficulty in proving beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat the value of the promised information exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation, see 52 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(1)(A)(i). \ni. Thing-of-Value Element \nA threshold legal question is whether providing to a campaign \u201cdocuments and \ninformation\u201d of the type involved here would constitute a prohibited campaign contribution.  The \nforeign contribution ban is not limited to contributions of money. It expressly prohibits \u201ca \ncontribution or donation of money or other thing of value.\u201d 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30121(a)(1)(A), (a)(2) \n(emphasis added). And the term \u201ccontribution\u201d is defined throughout the campaign-finance laws \nto \u201cinclude[]\u201d \u201cany gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value.\u201d \n52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101(8)(A)(i) (emphasis added).   \nThe phrases \u201cthing of value\u201d and \u201canything of value\u201d are broad and inclusive enough to \nencompass at least some forms of valuable information. Throughout the United States Code, these \nphrases serve as \u201cterm[s] of art\u201d that are construed \u201cbroad[ly].\u201d  United States v. Nilsen, 967 F.2d \n539, 542 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam) (\u201cthing of value\u201d includes \u201cboth tangibles and intangibles\u201d); \nsee also, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201(b)(1), 666(a)(2) (bribery statutes); id. \u00a7 641 (theft of government \nproperty). For example, the term \u201cthing of value\u201d encompasses law enforcement reports that \nwould reveal the identity of informants, United States v. Girard, 601 F.2d 69, 71 (2d Cir. 1979); \nclassified materials, United States v. Fowler, 932 F.2d 306, 310 (4th Cir. 1991); confidential \ninformation about a competitive bid, United States v. Matzkin, 14 F.3d 1014, 1020 (4th Cir. 1994); \nsecret grand jury information, United States v.

A campaign can be assisted not only by the provision of funds, \nbut also by the provision of derogatory information about an opponent. Political campaigns \nfrequently conduct and pay for opposition research.   A foreign entity that engaged in such research \nand provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and \na greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things \nof value. \nAt the same time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of \nuncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount \nto a contribution under campaign-finance law. Such an interpretation could have implications \nbeyond the foreign-source ban, see 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30116(a) (imposing monetary limits on campaign \ncontributions), and raise First Amendment questions. Those questions could be especially difficult \nwhere the information consisted simply of the recounting of historically accurate facts. It is \nuncertain how courts would resolve those issues.     \nii. Willfulness  \nEven assuming that the promised \u201cdocuments and information that would incriminate \nHillary\u201d constitute a \u201cthing of value\u201d under campaign-finance law, the government would \nencounter other challenges in seeking to obtain and sustain a conviction. Most significantly, the \ngovernment has not obtained admissible evidence that is likely to establish the scienter requirement \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. To prove that a defendant acted \u201cknowingly and willfully,\u201d the \ngovernment would have to show that the defendant had general knowledge that his conduct was \nunlawful. U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses 123 (8th ed. Dec. \n2017) (\u201cElection Offenses\u201d); see Bluman, 800 F. Supp. 2d at 292 (noting that a willful violation \nrequires \u201cproof of the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the law\u201d); Danielczyk, 917 F. Supp. 2d at 577 \n(\u201cknowledge of general unlawfulness\u201d). \u201cThis standard creates an elevated scienter element \nrequiring, at the very least, that application of the law to the facts in question be fairly clear. When \nthere is substantial doubt concerning whether the law applies to the facts of a particular matter, the \noffender is more likely to have an intent defense.\u201d Election Offenses 123. \nOn the facts here, the government would unlikely be able to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that the June 9 meeting participants had general knowledge that their conduct was unlawful.  \nThe investigation has not developed evidence that the participants in the meeting were familiar \nwith the foreign-contribution ban or the application of federal law to the relevant factual context.  \nThe government does not have strong evidence of surreptitious behavior or efforts at concealment \nat the time of the June 9 meeting. While the government has evidence of later efforts to prevent \ndisclosure of the nature of the June 9 meeting that could circumstantially provide support for a \nshowing of scienter, see Volume II, Section II.G, infra, that concealment occurred more than a \nyear later, involved individuals who did not attend the June 9 meeting, and may reflect an intention \nto avoid political consequences rather than any prior knowledge of illegality. Additionally, in light \nof the unresolved legal questions about whether giving \u201cdocuments and information\u201d of the sort \noffered here constitutes a campaign contribution, Trump Jr. could mount a factual defense that he \n187 \n",

Given his \nless direct involvement in arranging the June 9 meeting, Kushner could likely mount a similar \ndefense. And, while Manafort is experienced with political campaigns, the Office has not \ndeveloped evidence showing that he had relevant knowledge of these legal issues.  \niii. Difficulties in Valuing Promised Information \nThe Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the \nvalue of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal \nviolation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109(d)(1).  \nThe type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions\u2014such \nas pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost \nor the cost of distribution\u2014would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting. \nAlthough damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the \ninformation ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable. And while value in a conspiracy \nmay well be measured by what the participants expected to receive at the time of the agreement, \nsee, e.g., United States v. Tombrello, 666 F.2d 485, 489 (11th Cir. 1982), Goldstone\u2019s description \nof the offered material here was quite general. His suggestion of the information\u2019s value\u2014i.e., \nthat it would \u201cincriminate Hillary\u201d and \u201cwould be very useful to [Trump Jr.\u2019s] father\u201d\u2014was non-\nspecific and may have been understood as being of uncertain worth or reliability, given \nGoldstone\u2019s lack of direct access to the original source. The uncertainty over what would be \ndelivered could be reflected in Trump Jr.\u2019s response (\u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it\u201d) (emphasis \nadded). \nAccordingly, taking into account the high burden to establish a culpable mental state in a \ncampaign-finance prosecution and the difficulty in establishing the required valuation, the Office \ndecided not to pursue criminal campaign-finance charges against Trump Jr. or other campaign \nofficials for the events culminating in the June 9 meeting.   \nc.

False Statements and Obstruction of the Investigation \nThe Office determined that certain individuals associated with the Campaign lied to \ninvestigators about Campaign contacts with Russia and have taken other actions to interfere with \nthe investigation. As explained below, the Office therefore charged some U.S. persons connected \nto the Campaign with false statements and obstruction offenses. \na. Overview Of Governing Law \nFalse Statements. \nThe principal federal statute criminalizing false statements to  \ngovernment investigators is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. As relevant here, under Section 1001(a)(2), it is a \ncrime to knowingly and willfully \u201cmake[] any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement \nor representation\u201d \u201cin any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive . . . branch of the \nGovernment.\u201d An FBI investigation is a matter within the Executive Branch\u2019s jurisdiction. United \nStates v. Rodgers, 466 U.S. 475, 479 (1984). The statute also applies to a subset of legislative \nbranch actions\u2014viz., administrative matters and \u201cinvestigation[s] or review[s]\u201d conducted by a \ncongressional committee or subcommittee. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(c)(1) and (2); see United States v. \nPickett, 353 F.3d 62, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \nWhether the statement was made to law enforcement or congressional investigators, the \ngovernment must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the same basic non-jurisdictional elements:  \nthe statement was false, fictitious, or fraudulent; the defendant knew both that it was false and that \nit was unlawful to make a false statement; and the false statement was material. See, e.g., United \nStates v. Smith, 831 F.3d 1207, 1222 n.27 (9th Cir. 2017) (listing elements); see also Ninth Circuit \nPattern Instruction 8.73 & cmt. (explaining that the Section 1001 jury instruction was modified in \nlight of the Department of Justice\u2019s position that the phrase \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d in the statute \nrequires the defendant\u2019s knowledge that his or her conduct was unlawful). In the D.C. Circuit, the \ngovernment must prove that the statement was actually false; a statement that is misleading but \n\u201cliterally true\u201d does not satisfy Section 1001(a)(2). See United States v. Milton, 8 F.3d 39, 45 \n191 \n",

For that \nfalse statement to qualify as \u201cmaterial,\u201d it must have a natural tendency to influence, or be capable \nof influencing, a discrete decision or any other function of the agency to which it is addressed.

Under the federal perjury statutes, it is a crime for a witness testifying under oath \nbefore a grand jury to knowingly make any false material declaration. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623. The \ngovernment must prove four elements beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction under \nSection 1623(a): the defendant testified under oath before a federal grand jury; the defendant\u2019s \ntestimony was false in one or more respects; the false testimony concerned matters that were \nmaterial to the grand jury investigation; and the false testimony was knowingly given. United \nStates v. Bridges, 717 F.2d 1444, 1449 n.30 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The general perjury statute, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1621, also applies to grand jury testimony and has similar elements, except that it requires \nthat the witness have acted willfully and that the government satisfy \u201cstrict common-law \nrequirements for establishing falsity.\u201d See Dunn v. United States, 442 U.S. 100, 106 & n.6 (1979) \n(explaining \u201cthe two-witness rule\u201d and the corroboration that it demands).            \nObstruction of Justice. Three basic elements are common to the obstruction statutes \npertinent to this Office\u2019s charging decisions:  an obstructive act; some form of nexus between the \nobstructive act and an official proceeding; and criminal (i.e., corrupt) intent. A detailed discussion \nof those elements, and the law governing obstruction of justice more generally, is included in \nVolume II of the report.   \nb. Application to Certain Individuals \ni. George Papadopoulos \nInvestigators approached Papadopoulos for an interview based on his role as a foreign \npolicy advisor to the Trump Campaign and his suggestion to a foreign government representative \nthat Russia had indicated that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of \ninformation damaging to candidate Clinton. On January 27, 2017, Papadopoulos agreed to be \ninterviewed by FBI agents, who informed him that the interview was part of the investigation into \npotential Russian government interference in the 2016 presidential election.  \nDuring the interview, Papadopoulos lied about the timing, extent, and nature of his \ncommunications with Joseph Mifsud, Olga Polonskaya, and Ivan Timofeev. With respect to \ntiming, Papadopoulos acknowledged that he had met Mifsud and that Mifsud told him the Russians \nhad \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of \u201cthousands of emails.\u201d But Papadopoulos stated multiple \ntimes that those communications occurred before he joined the Trump Campaign and that it was a \n\u201cvery strange coincidence\u201d to be told of the \u201cdirt\u201d before he started working for the Campaign.  \nThis account was false. Papadopoulos met Mifsud for the first time on approximately March 14, \n2016, after Papadopoulos had already learned he would be a foreign policy advisor for the \nCampaign. Mifsud showed interest in Papadopoulos only after learning of his role on the \nCampaign. And Mifsud told Papadopoulos about the Russians possessing \u201cdirt\u201d on candidate \nClinton in late April 2016, more than a month after Papadopoulos had joined the Campaign and \n192 \n",

Oct. 5, 2017), Doc. 19 (\u201cPapadopoulos Statement \nof Offense\u201d). \nPapadopoulos also made false statements in an effort to minimize the extent and \nimportance of his communications with Mifsud. \nFor example, Papadopoulos stated that \n\u201c[Mifsud]\u2019s a nothing,\u201d that he thought Mifsud was \u201cjust a guy talk[ing] up connections or \nsomething,\u201d and that he believed Mifsud was \u201cBS\u2019ing to be completely honest with you.\u201d In fact, \nhowever, Papadopoulos understood Mifsud to have substantial connections to high-level Russian \ngovernment officials and that Mifsud spoke with some of those officials in Moscow before telling \nPapadopoulos about the \u201cdirt.\u201d Papadopoulos also engaged in extensive communications over a \nperiod of months with Mifsud about foreign policy issues for the Campaign, including efforts to \narrange a \u201chistory making\u201d meeting between the Campaign and Russian government officials.  In \naddition, Papadopoulos failed to inform investigators that Mifsud had introduced him to Timofeev, \nthe Russian national who Papadopoulos understood to be connected to the Russian Ministry of \nForeign Affairs, despite being asked if he had met with Russian nationals or \u201c[a]nyone with a \nRussian accent\u201d during the campaign.  Papadopoulos Statement of Offense \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.   \nPapadopoulos also falsely claimed that he met Polonskaya before he joined the Campaign, \nand falsely told the FBI that he had \u201cno\u201d relationship at all with her. He stated that the extent of \ntheir communications was her sending emails\u2014\u201cJust, \u2018Hi, how are you?\u2019 That\u2019s it.\u201d In truth, \nhowever, Papadopoulos met Polonskaya on March 24, 2016, after he had joined the Campaign; he \nbelieved that she had connections to high-level Russian government officials and could help him \narrange a potential foreign policy trip to Russia. During the campaign he emailed and spoke with \nher over Skype on numerous occasions about the potential foreign policy trip to Russia. \nPapadopoulos Statement of Offense \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.   \nPapadopoulos\u2019s false statements in January 2017 impeded the FBI\u2019s investigation into \nRussian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Most immediately, those statements \nhindered investigators\u2019 ability to effectively question Mifsud when he was interviewed in the lobby \nof a Washington, D.C. hotel on February 10, 2017. See Gov\u2019t Sent. Mem. at 6, United States v. \nGeorge Papadopoulos, No. 1:17-cr-182 (D.D.C. Aug. 18, 2017), Doc. 44.  During that interview, \nMifsud admitted to knowing Papadopoulos and to having introduced him to Polonskaya and \nTimofeev. But Mifsud denied that he had advance knowledge that Russia was in possession of \nemails damaging to candidate Clinton, stating that he and Papadopoulos had discussed \ncybersecurity and hacking as a larger issue and that Papadopoulos must have misunderstood their \nconversation. Mifsud also falsely stated that he had not seen Papadopoulos since the meeting at \nwhich Mifsud introduced him to Polonskaya, even though emails, text messages, and other \ninformation show that Mifsud met with Papadopoulos on at least two other occasions\u2014April 12 \nand April 26, 2016. In addition, Mifsud omitted that he had drafted (or edited) the follow-up \nmessage that Polonskaya sent to Papadopoulos following the initial meeting and that, as reflected \nin the language of that email chain (\u201cBaby, thank you!\u201d), Mifsud may have been involved in a \npersonal relationship with Polonskaya at the  time.  The false information and omissions in \nPapadopoulos\u2019s January 2017 interview undermined investigators\u2019 ability to challenge Mifsud \nwhen he made these inaccurate statements. \n193 \n",

Michael Flynn \nMichael Flynn agreed to be interviewed by the FBI on January 24, 2017, four days after he \nhad officially assumed his duties as National Security Advisor to the President. During the \ninterview, Flynn made several false statements pertaining to his communications with the Russian \nambassador.  \nFirst, Flynn made two false statements about his conversations with Russian Ambassador \nKislyak in late December 2016, at a time when the United States had imposed sanctions on Russia \nfor interfering with the 2016 presidential election and Russia was considering its response. See \nFlynn Statement of Offense. Flynn told the agents that he did not ask Kislyak to refrain from \nescalating the situation in response to the United States\u2019s imposition of sanctions.  That statement \nwas false. On December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak to request Russian restraint. Flynn made \nthe call immediately after speaking to a senior Transition Team official (K.T. McFarland) about \nwhat to communicate to Kislyak. Flynn then spoke with McFarland again after the Kislyak call to \nreport on the substance of that conversation. Flynn also falsely told the FBI that he did not \nremember a follow-up conversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate \nits response to the U.S. sanctions as a result of Flynn\u2019s request.  On December 31, 2016, Flynn in \nfact had such a conversation with Kislyak, and he again spoke with McFarland within hours of the \ncall to relay the substance of his conversation with Kislyak.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nSecond, Flynn made false statements about calls he had previously made to representatives \nof Russia and other countries regarding a resolution submitted by Egypt to the United Nations \nSecurity Council on December 21, 2016. Specifically, Flynn stated that he only asked the \ncountries\u2019 positions on how they would vote on the resolution and that he did not request that any \nof the countries take any particular action on the resolution. That statement was false. On \nDecember 22, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak, informed him of the incoming Trump Administration\u2019s \nopposition to the resolution, and requested that Russia vote against or delay the resolution.  Flynn \nalso falsely stated that Kislyak never described Russia\u2019s response to his December 22 request \nregarding the resolution. Kislyak in fact told Flynn in a conversation on December 23, 2016, that \nRussia would not vote against the resolution if it came to a vote.  See Flynn Statement of Offense \n\u00b6 4. \nFlynn made these false statements to the FBI at a time when he was serving as National \nSecurity Advisor and when the FBI had an open investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 \npresidential election, including the nature of any links between the Trump Campaign and Russia.  \nFlynn\u2019s false statements and omissions impeded and otherwise had a material impact on that \nongoing investigation. Flynn Statement of Offense \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. They also came shortly before Flynn \nmade separate submissions to the Department of Justice, pursuant to FARA, that also contained \nmaterially false statements and omissions. Id. \u00b6 5. Based on the totality of that conduct, the Office \ndecided to charge Flynn with making false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1001(a). On December 1, 2017, and pursuant to a plea agreement, Flynn pleaded guilty to that \ncharge and also admitted his false statements to the Department in his FARA filing.  See id.; Plea \nAgreement, United States v. Michael T. Flynn, No. 1:17-cr-232 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2017), Doc. 3.  \nFlynn is awaiting sentencing.          \niv.

From \nthe fall of 2015 through approximately June 2016, Cohen was involved in a project to build a \nTrump-branded tower and adjoining development in Moscow. The project was known as Trump \nTower Moscow. \nIn 2017, Cohen was called to testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), both of which were \ninvestigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible links between \nRussia and the presidential campaigns. In late August 2017, in advance of his testimony, Cohen \ncaused a two-page statement to be sent to SSCI and HPSCI addressing Trump Tower Moscow.  \nCohen Information \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. The letter contained three representations relevant here. First, Cohen \nstated that the Trump Moscow project had ended in January 2016 and that he had briefed candidate \nTrump on the project only three times before making the unilateral decision to terminate it. \nSecond, Cohen represented that he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project \nand never considered asking Trump to travel for the project. Third, Cohen stated that he did not \nrecall any Russian government contact about the project, including any response to an email that \n195 \n",

Cohen later asked \nthat his two-page statement be incorporated into his testimony\u2019s transcript before SSCI, and he \nultimately gave testimony to SSCI that was consistent with that statement. Cohen Information \u00b6 5.       \nEach of the foregoing representations in Cohen\u2019s two-page statement was false and  \nmisleading. Consideration of the project had extended through approximately June 2016 and \nincluded more than three progress reports from Cohen to Trump. Cohen had discussed with Felix \nSater his own travel to Russia as part of the project, and he had inquired about the possibility of \nTrump traveling there\u2014both with the candidate himself and with senior campaign official Corey \nLewandowski. Cohen did recall that he had received a response to the email that he sent to Russian \ngovernment spokesman Dmitry Peskov\u2014in particular, that he received an email reply and had a \nfollow-up phone conversation with an English-speaking assistant to Peskov in mid-January 2016.  \nCohen Information \u00b6 7. Cohen knew the statements in the letter to be false at the time, and \nadmitted that he made them in an effort (1) to minimize the links between the project and Trump \n(who by this time was President), and (2) to give the false impression that the project had ended \nbefore the first vote in the Republican Party primary process, in the hopes of limiting the ongoing \nRussia investigations. Id. \nGiven the nature of the false statements and the fact that he repeated them during his initial \ninterview with the Office, we charged Cohen with violating Section 1001. On November 29, 2018, \nCohen pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to a single-count information charging him \nwith making false statements in a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2) and (c).

The case was transferred to the \ndistrict judge presiding over the separate prosecution of Cohen pursued by the Southern District \nof New York (after a referral from our Office).  On December 7, 2018, this Office submitted a \nletter to that judge recommending that Cohen\u2019s cooperation with our investigation be taken into \naccount in sentencing Cohen on both the false-statements charge and the offenses in the Southern \nDistrict prosecution. On December 12, 2018, the judge sentenced Cohen to two months of \nimprisonment on the false-statements count, to run concurrently with a 36-month sentence \nimposed on the other counts.       \nv.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nforeign policy speech at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C., in April 2016, and that it is \npossible that they met briefly at that reception.  \nThe Office considered whether, in light of these interactions, Sessions committed perjury \nbefore, or made false statements to, Congress in connection with his confirmation as Attorney \nGeneral. In January 2017 testimony during his confirmation hearing, Sessions stated in response \nto a question about Trump Campaign communications with the Russian government that he had \n\u201cbeen called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn\u2019t have \u2013 did not have \ncommunications with the Russians.\u201d In written responses submitted on January 17, 2017, Sessions \nanswered \u201c[n]o\u201d to a question asking whether he had \u201cbeen in contact with anyone connected to \nany part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day.\u201d  \nAnd, in a March 2017 supplement to his testimony, Sessions identified two of the campaign-period \ncontacts with Ambassador Kislyak noted above, which had been reported in the media following \nthe January 2017 confirmation hearing. Sessions stated in the supplemental response that he did \n\u201cnot recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador, or any other representatives of the \nRussian government, regarding the political campaign on these occasions or any other occasion.\u201d  \nAlthough the investigation established that Sessions interacted with Kislyak on the \noccasions described above and that Kislyak mentioned the presidential campaign on at least one \noccasion, the evidence is not sufficient to prove that Sessions gave knowingly false answers to \nRussia-related questions in light of the wording and context of those questions. With respect to \nSessions\u2019s statements that he did \u201cnot recall any discussions with the Russian Ambassador . . . \nregarding the political campaign\u201d and he had not been in contact with any Russian official \u201cabout \nthe 2016 election,\u201d the evidence concerning the nature of Sessions\u2019s interactions with Kislyak \nmakes it plausible that Sessions did not recall discussing the campaign with Kislyak at the time of \nhis statements. Similarly, while Sessions stated in his January 2017 oral testimony that he \u201cdid \nnot have communications with Russians,\u201d he did so in response to a question that had linked such \ncommunications to an alleged \u201ccontinuing exchange of information\u201d between the Trump  \nCampaign and Russian government intermediaries. Sessions later explained to the Senate and to \nthe Office that he understood the question as narrowly calling for disclosure of interactions with \nRussians that involved the exchange of campaign information, as distinguished from more routine \ncontacts with Russian nationals. Given the context in which the question was asked, that \nunderstanding is plausible. \nAccordingly, the Office concluded that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Sessions \nwas willfully untruthful in his answers and thus insufficient to obtain or sustain a conviction for \nperjury or false statements. Consistent with the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office \ntherefore determined not to pursue charges against Sessions and informed his counsel of that \ndecision in March 2018. \nvii. Others Interviewed During the Investigation \nThe Office considered whether, during the course of the investigation, other individuals \ninterviewed either omitted material information or provided information determined to be false.  \nApplying the Principles of Federal Prosecution, the Office did not seek criminal charges against \nany individuals other than those listed above.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAPPENDIX C \nINTRODUCTORY NOTE \nThe President provided written responses through his personal counsel to questions \nsubmitted to him by the Special Counsel\u2019s Office. We first explain the process that led to the \nsubmission of written questions and then attach the President\u2019s responses. \nBeginning in December 2017, this Office sought for more than a year to interview the \nPresident on topics relevant to both Russian-election interference and obstruction-of-justice.  We \nadvised counsel that the President was a \u201csubject\u201d of the investigation under the definition of the \nJustice Manual\u2014\u201ca person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury\u2019s investigation.\u201d \nJustice Manual \u00a7 9-11.151 (2018).  We also advised counsel that \u201c[a]n interview with the President \nis vital to our investigation\u201d and that this Office had \u201ccarefully considered the constitutional and \nother arguments raised by . . .  counsel, and they d[id] not provide us with reason to forgo seeking \nan interview.\u201d1 We additionally stated that \u201cit is in the interest of the Presidency and the public \nfor an interview to take place\u201d and offered \u201cnumerous accommodations to aid the President\u2019s \npreparation and avoid surprise.\u201d2 After extensive discussions with the Department of Justice about \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s objective of securing the President\u2019s testimony, these accommodations \nincluded the submissions of written questions to the President on certain Russia-related topics.3 \nWe received the President\u2019s written responses in late November 2018.4 In December 2018, \nwe informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects.5  We noted, among \nother things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he \u201cdoes not \u2018recall\u2019 or \n\u2018remember\u2019 or have an \u2018independent recollection\u2019\u201d of information called for by the questions.6 \nOther answers were \u201cincomplete or imprecise.\u201d7 The written responses, we informed counsel, \n\u201cdemonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask follow-\nup questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client\u2019s recollection \nor clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection.\u201d8 We again requested an in-person \ninterview, limited to certain topics, advising the President\u2019s counsel that \u201c[t]his is the President\u2019s \n1 5/16/18 Letter, Special Counsel to the President\u2019s Personal Counsel, at 1. \n2 5/16/18 Letter, Special Counsels\u2019s Office to the President\u2019s Personal Counsel, at 1; see 7/30/18 \nLetter, Special Counsel\u2019s Office to the President\u2019s Personal Counsel, at 1 (describing accommodations).    \n3 9/17/18 Letter, Special Counsel\u2019s Office to the President\u2019s Personal Counsel, at 1 (submitting \nwritten questions).   \n4 11/20/18 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office (transmitting \nwritten responses of Donald J.

This was one of many busy months during a fast-paced campaign, as the primary \nseason was ending and we were preparing for the general election campaign. \nI am now aware that my Campaign's calendar indicates that I was in New York City from June 6 \n- 9, 2016.

When I was in New York City, I stayed at my \nTrump Tower apartment. \nMy Trump Organization desk calendar also reflects that I was outside Trump Tower during \nportions ofthese days. The June 7, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to leave Trump Tower \nin the early evening for Westchester where I gave remarks after winning the California, New \nJersey, New Mexico, Montana, and South Dakota Republican primaries held that day.

The June 9, 2016 calendar indicates I was scheduled to attend midday meetings and a \nfundraising luncheon at the Four Seasons Hotel. At this point, I do not remember on what dates \nthese events occurred, but I do not currently have a reason to doubt that they took place as \nscheduled on my calendar. \nWidely available media reports, including television footage, also shed light on my activities \nduring these days.

In light of that tragedy, I gave a speech directed more specifically to national security and \nterrorism than to the Clintons. That speech was delivered at the Saint Anselm College Institute of \nPolitics in Manchester, New Hampshire, and, as reported, opened with the following: \nThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, \nespecially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be. Even her \nformer Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times ofstress, \nhas stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president. There will \nbe plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will \ndeliver that speech soon. But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing \nthreat of terrorism inside ofour borders. \nI continued to speak about Mrs. Clinton' s failings throughout the campaign, using the information \nprepared for inclusion in the speech to which I referred on June 7, 2016. \nResponse to Question I, Part (h) \nl have no recollection of being told during the campaign that Vladimir Putin or the Russian \ngovernment \"supported\" my candidacy or \"opposed\" the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAPPENDIX D \nSPECIAL COUNSEL\u2019S OFFICE TRANSFERRED, REFERRED, AND COMPLETED CASES \nThis appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, as \nwell as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed.  \nA. Transfers \nThe Special Counsel\u2019s Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination \nbetween the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign.  Certain \nmatters assigned to the Office by the Acting Attorney General have not fully concluded as of the \ndate of this report.  After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office \nhas transferred responsibility for those matters to other components of the Department of Justice \nand the FBI.  Those transfers include: \n1. United States v. Bijan Rafiekian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin \nU.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia \n(Awaiting trial) \nThe Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other \nthings, possible criminal conduct by Michael Flynn in acting as an unregistered agent for the \nGovernment of Turkey.  See August 2, 2017 Memorandum from Rod J. Rosenstein to Robert S. \nMueller, III. The Acting Attorney General later confirmed the Special Counsel\u2019s authority to \ninvestigate Rafiekian and Alptekin because they \u201cmay have been jointly involved\u201d with Flynn in \nFARA-related crimes. See October 20, 2017 Memorandum from Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Scott Schools to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein.   \nOn December 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to an Information charging him with making \nfalse statements to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States. \nAs part of that plea, Flynn agreed to a Statement of the Offense in which he acknowledged that \nthe Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) documents he filed on March 7, 2017 \u201ccontained \nmaterially false statements and omissions.\u201d Flynn\u2019s plea occurred before the Special Counsel had \nmade a final decision on whether to charge Rafiekian or Alptekin.  On March 27, 2018, after \nconsultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office referred \nthe investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin to the National Security Division (NSD) for any action \nit deemed appropriate. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office determined the referral was appropriate \nbecause the investigation of Flynn had been completed, and that investigation had provided the \nrationale for the Office\u2019s investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin.  At NSD\u2019s request, the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia continued the investigation of Rafiekian and Alptekin. \n2. United States v.

RUSSIAN HACKING AND DUMPING OPERATIONS \nBeginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate \nof the General Staff (GRU) hacked the computers and email accounts of organizations, employees, \nand volunteers supporting the Clinton Campaign, including the email account of campaign \nchairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the \nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National \nCommittee (DNC). The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton Campaign \nemployees, advisors, and volunteers. In total, the GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents \nfrom the compromised email accounts and networks.109  The GRU later released stolen Clinton \nCampaign and DNC documents through online personas, \u201cDCLeaks\u201d and \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d and later \nthrough the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents was designed and timed to \ninterfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine the Clinton Campaign.  \nThe Trump Campaign showed interest in the WikiLeaks releases and, in the summer and \nfall of 2016, Harm to Ongoing Matter\n \n  After \nHOM\n \n, the Trump Campaign \nstayed in contact \nabout WikiLeaks\u2019s activities. The investigation was unable to resolve \nWikiLeaks\u2019s release of the stolen Podesta emails on October 7, \n2016, the same  day a  video from  years earlier was published of Trump using graphic language \nabout women.    \nHOM\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\ncampaigns.112 \na bitcoin mining operation to \nInvestigative Technique\nA. GRU Hacking Directed at the Clinton Campaign \n1. GRU Units Target the Clinton Campaign \nTwo military units of the GRU carried out the computer intrusions into the Clinton \nCampaign, DNC, and DCCC: Military Units 26165 and 74455.110  Military Unit 26165 is a GRU \ncyber unit dedicated to targeting military, political, governmental, and non-governmental \norganizations outside of Russia, including in the United States.111 The unit was sub-divided into \ndepartments with different specialties. One department, for example, developed specialized \nmalicious software (\u201cmalware\u201d), while another department conducted large-scale spearphishing \n109 As discussed in Section V below, our Office charged 12 GRU officers for crimes arising from \nthe hacking of these computers, principally with conspiring to commit computer intrusions, in violation of \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71030 and 371.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n2. Intrusions into the DCCC and DNC Networks \na. Initial Access \nBy no later than April 12, 2016, the GRU had gained access to the DCCC computer \nnetwork using the credentials stolen from a DCCC employee who had been successfully \nspearphished the week before. Over the ensuing weeks, the GRU traversed the network, \nidentifying different computers connected to the DCCC network. By stealing network access \ncredentials along the way (including those of IT administrators with unrestricted access to the \nsystem), the GRU compromised approximately 29 different computers on the DCCC network.119 \nApproximately six days after first hacking into the DCCC network, on April 18, 2016, \nGRU officers gained access to the DNC network via a virtual private network (VPN) connection120 \nbetween the DCCC and DNC networks.121 Between April 18, 2016 and June 8, 2016, Unit 26165 \ncompromised more than 30 computers on the DNC network, including the DNC mail server and \nshared file server.122 \nb. Implantation of Malware on DCCC and DNC Networks \nUnit 26165 implanted on the DCCC and DNC networks two types of customized \nmalware,123 known as \u201cX-Agent\u201d and \u201cX-Tunnel\u201d; Mimikatz, a credential-harvesting tool; and \nrar.exe, a tool used in these intrusions to compile and compress materials for exfiltration. X-Agent \nwas a multi-function hacking tool that allowed Unit 26165 to log keystrokes, take screenshots, and \ngather other data about the infected computers (e.g., file directories, operating systems).124  X-\nTunnel was a hacking tool that created an encrypted connection between the victim DCCC/DNC \ncomputers and GRU-controlled computers outside the DCCC and DNC networks that was capable \nof large-scale data transfers.125 GRU officers then used X-Tunnel to exfiltrate stolen data from the \nvictim computers. \n119 Investigative Technique\n120 A VPN extends a private network, allowing users to send and receive data across public \nnetworks (such as the internet) as if the connecting computer was directly connected to the private network. \nThe VPN in this case had been created to give a small number of DCCC employees access to certain \ndatabases housed on the DNC network. Therefore, while the DCCC employees were outside the DNC\u2019s \nprivate network, they could access parts of the DNC network from their DCCC computers. \n121 \nSM-2589105-HACK, serial 5.\n \n \n122 \nM-2589105-HACK, serial 5. \nInvestigative Technique\n \nInvestigative Technique\n123 \u201cMalware\u201d is short for malicious software, and here refers to software designed to allow a third \nparty to infiltrate a computer without the consent or knowledge of the computer\u2019s user or operator.   \n124 \n125 \nInvestigative Technique\nInvestigative Technique\n38 \n",

Dissemination of the Hacked Materials \nThe GRU\u2019s operations extended beyond stealing materials, and included releasing \ndocuments stolen from the Clinton Campaign and its supporters.  The GRU carried out the  \nanonymous release through two fictitious online personas that it created\u2014DCLeaks and Guccifer \n2.0\u2014and later through the organization WikiLeaks.   \n1. DCLeaks \nThe GRU began planning the releases at least as early as April 19, 2016, when Unit 26165 \nregistered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant.137 Unit 26165 \npaid for the registration using a pool of bitcoin that it had mined.138 The dcleaks.com landing page \npointed to different tranches of stolen documents, arranged by victim or subject matter. Other \ndcleaks.com pages contained indexes of the stolen emails that were being released (bearing the \nsender, recipient, and date of the email). To control access and the timing of releases, pages were \nsometimes password-protected for a period of time and later made unrestricted to the public.   \nStarting in June 2016, the GRU posted stolen documents onto the website dcleaks.com, \nincluding documents stolen from a number of individuals associated with the Clinton Campaign.  \nThese documents appeared to have originated from personal email accounts (in particular, Google \nand Microsoft accounts), rather than the DNC and DCCC computer networks. DCLeaks victims \nincluded an advisor to the Clinton Campaign, a former DNC employee and Clinton Campaign \nemployee, and four other campaign volunteers.139 \nThe GRU released through dcleaks.com \nthousands of documents, including personal identifying and financial information, internal \ncorrespondence related to the Clinton Campaign and prior political jobs, and fundraising files and \ninformation.140 \n136 Netyksho Indictment \u00b6 29.

GRU officers using the DCLeaks persona gave certain reporters early access \nto archives of leaked files by sending them links and passwords to pages on the dcleaks.com \nwebsite that had not yet become public. For example, on July 14, 2016, GRU officers operating \nunder the DCLeaks persona sent a link and password for a non-public DCLeaks webpage to a U.S. \nreporter via the Facebook account.143 Similarly, on September 14, 2016, GRU officers sent \nreporters Twitter direct messages from @dcleaks_, with a password to another non-public part of \nthe dcleaks.com website.144 \nThe DCLeaks.com website remained operational and public until March 2017.   \n2.

In the hours leading up \nto the launch of that WordPress blog, GRU officers logged into a Moscow-based server used and \nmanaged by Unit 74455 and searched for a number of specific words and phrases in English, \nincluding \u201csome hundred sheets,\u201d \u201cilluminati,\u201d and \u201cworldwide known.\u201d Approximately two \nhours after the last of those searches, Guccifer 2.0 published its first post, attributing the DNC \nserver hack to a lone Romanian hacker and using several of the unique English words and phrases \nthat the GRU officers had searched for that day.146 \nTennessee-based web-hosting company, called Smartech Corporation.

The \nGuccifer 2.0 persona ultimately released thousands of documents stolen from the DNC and DCCC \nin a series of blog posts between June 15, 2016 and October 18, 2016.147 Released documents \nincluded opposition research performed by the DNC (including a memorandum analyzing \npotential criticisms of candidate Trump), internal policy documents (such as recommendations on \nhow to address politically sensitive issues), analyses of specific congressional races, and \nfundraising documents. Releases were organized around thematic issues, such as specific states \n(e.g., Florida and Pennsylvania) that were perceived as competitive in the 2016 U.S. presidential \nelection. \nBeginning in late June 2016, the GRU also used the Guccifer 2.0 persona to release \ndocuments directly to reporters and other interested individuals. Specifically, on June 27, 2016, \nGuccifer 2.0 sent an email to the news outlet The Smoking Gun offering to provide \u201cexclusive \naccess to some leaked emails linked [to] Hillary Clinton\u2019s staff.\u201d148  The GRU later sent  the  \nreporter a password and link to a locked portion of the dcleaks.com website that contained an \narchive of emails stolen by Unit 26165 from a Clinton Campaign volunteer in March 2016.149  That \nthe Guccifer 2.0 persona provided reporters access to a restricted portion of the DCLeaks website \ntends to indicate that both personas were operated by the same or a closely-related group of \npeople.150 \nThe GRU continued its release efforts through Guccifer 2.0 into August 2016. For \nexample, on August 15, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a candidate for the U.S. Congress \ndocuments related to the candidate\u2019s opponent.151 On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona \ntransferred approximately 2.5 gigabytes of Florida-related data stolen from the DCCC to a U.S. \nblogger covering Florida politics.152 On August 22, 2016, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent a U.S. \nreporter documents stolen from the DCCC pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement.153 \n147 Releases of documents on the Guccifer 2.0 blog occurred on June 15, 2016; June 20, 2016; June \n21, 2016; July 6, 2016; July 14, 2016; August 12, 2016; August 15, 2016; August 21, 2016; August 31, \n2016; September 15, 2016; September 23, 2016; October 4, 2016; and October 18, 2016. \nIT\n148 6/27/16 Email, guccifer20@aol.fr to Personal Privacy\n(subject \u201cleaked emails\u201d); \n. \nPersonal Privacy\nIT\n149 6/27/16 Email, guccifer20@aol.fr to \n(subject \nPersonal Privacy\n; see also 6/27/16 Email, guccifer20@aol.fr to \n(subject \u201cleaked emails\u201d);  \n(claiming DCLeaks was a \u201cWikileaks sub \nproject\u201d). \n\u201cleaked emails\u201d); \n150 Before sending the reporter the link and password to the closed DCLeaks website, and in an \napparent effort to deflect attention from the fact that DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 were operated by the same \norganization, the Guccifer 2.0 persona sent the reporter an email stating that DCLeaks was a \u201cWikileaks \nsub project\u201d and that Guccifer 2.0 had asked DCLeaks to release the leaked emails with \u201cclosed access\u201d to \ngive reporters a preview of them.  \n151 Netyksho Indictment \u00b6 43(a). \n152 Netyksho Indictment \u00b6 43(b). \n153 Netyksho Indictment \u00b6 43(c). \n43 \n",

Firstly because its useful and will \nannoy Hillary, but secondly because we want to be seen to be a resource/player in the US \nelection, because eit [sic] may en[]courage people to send us even more important leaks.158 \nb. WikiLeaks\u2019s First Contact with Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks \nShortly after the GRU\u2019s first release of stolen documents through dcleaks.com in June \n2016, GRU officers also used the DCLeaks persona to contact WikiLeaks about possible \ncoordination in the future release of stolen emails. On June 14, 2016, @dcleaks_ sent a direct \nmessage to @WikiLeaks, noting, \u201cYou announced your organization was preparing to publish \nmore Hillary\u2019s emails. We are ready to support you. We have some sensitive information too, in \nparticular, her financial documents. Let\u2019s do it together. What  do you think about publishing our \ninfo at the same moment? Thank you.\u201d159 Investigative Technique\nAround the same time, WikiLeaks initiated communications with the GRU persona  \nGuccifer 2.0 shortly after it was used to release documents stolen from the DNC. On June 22, \n2016, seven days after Guccifer 2.0\u2019s first releases of stolen DNC documents, WikiLeaks used \nTwitter\u2019s direct message function to contact the Guccifer 2.0 Twitter account and suggest that \nGuccifer 2.0 \u201c[s]end any new material [stolen from the DNC] here for us to review and it will have \na much higher impact than what you are doing.\u201d160 \nOn July 6, 2016, WikiLeaks again contacted Guccifer 2.0 through Twitter\u2019s private \nmessaging function, writing, \u201cif you have anything hillary related we want it in the next tweo [sic] \ndays prefable [sic] because the DNC is approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind \nher after.\u201d The Guccifer 2.0 persona responded, \u201cok . . . i see.\u201d WikiLeaks also explained, \u201cwe \nthink trump has only a 25% chance of winning against hillary . . . so conflict between bernie and \nhillary is interesting.\u201d161 \nc. The GRU\u2019s Transfer of Stolen Materials to WikiLeaks \nBoth the GRU and WikiLeaks sought to hide their communications,  which  has limited the  \nOffice\u2019s ability to  collect all of the communications between them.  Thus, although it is clear that \nthe stolen DNC and Podesta documents were transferred from  the GRU to WikiLeaks, \nInvestigative Technique\n158 3/14/16 Twitter DM, @WikiLeaks to PP\nLess than two weeks earlier, the same \naccount had been used to send a private message opposing the idea of Clinton \u201cin whitehouse with her \nbloodlutt and amitions [sic] of empire with hawkish liberal-interventionist appointees.\u201d 11/19/15 Twitter \nGroup Chat, Group ID 594242937858486276, @WikiLeaks et al.   \n159 6/14/16 Twitter DM, @dcleaks_ to @WikiLeaks. \n160 Netyksho Indictment \u00b6 47(a).  \n161 7/6/16 Twitter DMs, @WikiLeaks & @guccifer_2. \n45 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n176 \nInvestigative Technique\nOn October 7, 2016, WikiLeaks released the first emails stolen from the Podesta email \naccount. In total, WikiLeaks released 33 tranches of stolen emails between October 7, 2016 and \nNovember 7, 2016. \nThe releases included private speeches given by Clinton;177 internal \ncommunications between Podesta and other high-ranking members of the Clinton Campaign;178 \nand correspondence related to the Clinton Foundation.179 In total, WikiLeaks released over 50,000 \ndocuments stolen from Podesta\u2019s personal email account. The last-in-time email released from \nPodesta\u2019s account was dated March 21, 2016, two days after Podesta received a spearphishing \nemail sent by the GRU.   \nd. WikiLeaks Statements Dissembling About the Source of Stolen Materials \nAs reports attributing the DNC and DCCC hacks to the Russian government emerged, \nWikiLeaks and Assange made several public statements apparently designed to obscure the source \nof the materials that WikiLeaks was releasing. The file-transfer evidence described above and \nother information uncovered during the investigation discredit WikiLeaks\u2019s claims about the \nsource of material that it posted.  \nBeginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements \nabout Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016.  The statements about \nRich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails. On August 9, 2016, \nthe @WikiLeaks Twitter account posted: \u201cANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a \nUS$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.\u201d180 \nLikewise, on August 25, 2016, Assange was asked in an interview, \u201cWhy are you so interested in \nSeth Rich\u2019s killer?\u201d and responded, \u201cWe\u2019re very interested in anything that might be a threat to \nalleged Wikileaks sources.\u201d The interviewer responded to Assange\u2019s statement by commenting, \n\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to reveal your source, but it certainly sounds like you\u2019re suggesting a man \nwho leaked information to WikiLeaks was then murdered.\u201d  Assange replied, \u201cIf there\u2019s someone \nwho\u2019s potentially connected to our publication, and that person has been murdered in suspicious \n176 Investigative Technique\n \n \n \n \n \n177 \n178 \nPersonal Privacy\nPersonal Privacy\n179 Netyksho Indictment \u00b6 43.  \n180 @WikiLeaks 8/9/16 Tweet. \n48 \n",

According to media reports, Assange told a U.S. \ncongressman that the DNC hack was an \u201cinside job,\u201d and purported to have \u201cphysical proof\u201d that \nRussians did not give materials to Assange.182 \nC. Additional GRU Cyber Operations \nWhile releasing the stolen emails and documents through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0, and \nWikiLeaks, GRU officers continued to target and hack victims linked to the Democratic campaign \nand, eventually, to target entities responsible for election administration in several states.     \n1. Summer and Fall 2016 Operations Targeting Democrat-Linked Victims \nOn July 27, 2016, Unit 26165 targeted \nPP\nemail accounts connected to candidate Clinton\u2019s \npersonal office \n. Earlier that day, candidate Trump made public statements that \nincluded the following: \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails \nthat are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d183 The \u201c30,000 \nemails\u201d were apparently a reference to emails described in media accounts as having been stored \non a personal server that candidate Clinton had used while serving as Secretary of State.   \nWithin approximately five hours of Trump\u2019s statement, GRU officers targeted for the first \ntime Clinton\u2019s personal office. After candidate Trump\u2019s remarks, Unit 26165 created and \nPP\nsent \nmalicious links targeting 15 email \nPP\naccounts at the domain \nincluding an email \naccount belonging to Clinton aide \nThe investigation did not find evidence of earlier \nGRU attempts to compromise accounts hosted on this domain. It is unclear how the GRU was \nable to identify these email accounts, which were not public.184 \nUnit 26165 officers also hacked into a DNC account hosted on a cloud-computing service \n  On September 20, 2016, the GRU began to generate \ncopies of the DNC data using \n function designed to allow users to produce backups of \ndatabases (referred to \nas \u201csnapshots\u201d).

The GRU stole approximately 300 gigabytes of data from the DNC cloud-\nbased account.185 \n2. Intrusions Targeting the Administration of U.S. Elections \nIn addition to targeting individuals involved in the Clinton Campaign, GRU officers also \ntargeted individuals and entities involved in the administration of the elections.   Victims included \nU.S. state and local entities, such as state boards of elections (SBOEs), secretaries of state, and \ncounty governments, as well as individuals who worked for those entities.186  The GRU also \ntargeted private technology firms responsible for manufacturing and administering election-related \nsoftware and hardware, such as voter registration software and electronic polling stations.187  The \nGRU continued to target these victims through the elections in November 2016. While the \ninvestigation identified evidence that the GRU targeted these individuals and entities, the Office \ndid not investigate further. The Office did not, for instance, obtain or examine servers or other \nrelevant items belonging to these victims. The Office understands that the FBI, the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and the states have separately investigated that activity. \nBy at least the summer of 2016, GRU officers sought access to state and local computer \nnetworks by exploiting known software vulnerabilities on websites of state and local governmental \nentities.  GRU officers, for example, targeted state and local databases of registered voters using a \ntechnique known as \u201cSQL injection,\u201d by which malicious code was sent to the state or local \nwebsite in order to run commands (such as exfiltrating the database contents).188 In one instance \nin approximately June 2016, the GRU compromised the computer network of the Illinois State \nBoard of Elections by exploiting a vulnerability in the SBOE\u2019s website. The GRU then gained \naccess to a database containing information on millions of registered Illinois voters,189 and \nextracted data related to thousands of U.S. voters before the malicious activity was identified.190 \nGRU officers \nscanned state and local websites for \nvulnerabilities.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n2. Other Potential Campaign Interest in Russian Hacked Materials \nThroughout 2016, the Trump Campaign expressed interest in Hillary Clinton\u2019s private \nemail server and whether approximately 30,000 emails from that server had in fact been \npermanently destroyed, as reported by the media. Several individuals associated with the \nCampaign were contacted in 2016 about various efforts to obtain the missing Clinton emails and \nother stolen material in support of the Trump Campaign.   Some of these contacts were met with \nskepticism, and nothing came of them; others were pursued to some degree. The investigation did \nnot find evidence that the Trump Campaign recovered any such Clinton emails, or that these \ncontacts were part of a coordinated effort between Russia and the Trump Campaign. \na. Henry Oknyansky (a/k/a Henry Greenberg) \nIn the spring of 2016, Trump Campaign advisor Michael Caputo learned through a Florida-\nbased Russian business partner that another Florida-based Russian, Henry Oknyansky (who also \nwent by the name Henry Greenberg), claimed to have information pertaining to Hillary Clinton. \nCaputo notified Roger Stone and brokered communication between Stone and Oknyansky. \nOknyansky and Stone set up a May 2016 in-person meeting.260 \nOknyansky was accompanied to the meeting by Alexei Rasin, a Ukrainian associate \ninvolved in Florida real estate. At the meeting, Rasin offered to sell Stone derogatory information \non Clinton that Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Rasin claimed to \npossess financial statements demonstrating Clinton\u2019s involvement in money laundering with \nRasin\u2019s companies. According to Oknyansky, Stone asked if the amounts in question totaled \nmillions of dollars but was told it was closer to hundreds of thousands. Stone refused the offer, \nstating that Trump would not pay for opposition research.261 \nOknyansky claimed to the Office that Rasin\u2019s motivation was financial. According to \nOknyansky, Rasin had tried unsuccessfully to shop the Clinton information around to other \ninterested parties, and Oknyansky would receive a cut if the information was sold.262  Rasin is \nnoted in public source documents as the director and/or registered agent for a number of Florida \ncompanies, none of which appears to be connected to Clinton. The Office found no other evidence \nthat Rasin worked for Clinton or any Clinton-related entities. \nIn their statements to investigators, Oknyansky and Caputo had contradictory recollections \nabout the meeting. Oknyansky claimed that Caputo accompanied Stone to the meeting and \nprovided an introduction, whereas Caputo did not tell us that he had attended and claimed that he \nwas never told what information Oknyansky offered. Caputo also stated that he was unaware \nOknyansky sought to be paid for the information until Stone informed him after the fact.263 \n260 Caputo 5/2/18 302, at 4; Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1.  \n261 Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1-2. \n262 Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 2. \n263 Caputo 5/2/18 302, at 4; Oknyansky 7/13/18 302, at 1. \n61 \n",

Finally, the investigation \ndid not identify evidence of a connection between the outreach or the meeting and Russian \ninterference efforts. \nb. Campaign Efforts to Obtain Deleted Clinton Emails \nAfter candidate Trump stated on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would \u201cfind the \n30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Trump asked individuals affiliated with his Campaign to find the \ndeleted Clinton emails.264 Michael Flynn\u2014who would later serve as National Security Advisor in \nthe Trump Administration\u2014recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly, and Flynn \nsubsequently contacted multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails.265 \nBarbara Ledeen and Peter Smith were among the people contacted by Flynn. Ledeen, a \nlong-time Senate staffer who had previously sought the Clinton emails, provided updates to Flynn \nabout her efforts throughout the summer of 2016.266 Smith, an investment advisor who was active \nin Republican politics, also attempted to locate and obtain the deleted Clinton emails.267 \nLedeen began her efforts to obtain the Clinton emails before Flynn\u2019s request, as early as \nDecember 2015.268 On December 3, 2015, she emailed Smith a proposal to obtain the emails, \nstating, \u201cHere is the proposal I briefly mentioned to you. The person I described to you would be \nhappy to talk with you either in person or over the phone.  The person can get the emails which 1. \nWere classified and 2. Were purloined by our enemies. That would demonstrate what needs to be \ndemonstrated.\u201d269 \nAttached to the email was a 25-page proposal stating that the \u201cClinton email server was, in \nall likelihood, breached long ago,\u201d and that the Chinese, Russian, and Iranian intelligence services \ncould \u201cre-assemble the server\u2019s email content.\u201d270 The proposal called for a three-phase approach.  \nThe first two phases consisted of open-source analysis. The third phase consisted of checking with \ncertain intelligence sources \u201cthat have access through liaison work with various foreign services\u201d \nto determine if any of those services had gotten to the server.   The proposal noted, \u201cEven if a \nsingle email was recovered and the providence [sic] of that email was a foreign service, it would \nbe catastrophic to the Clinton campaign[.]\u201d Smith forwarded the email to two colleagues and \n264 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 5-6; Flynn 5/1/18 302, at 1-3. \n265 Flynn 5/1/18 302, at 1-3. \n266 Flynn 4/25/18 302, at 7; Flynn 5/4/18 302, at 1-2; Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7-8. \n267 Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7. \n268 Szobocsan 3/29/17 302, at 1. \n269 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith.  \n270 12/3/15 Email, Ledeen to Smith (attachment). \n62 \n",

He created a company, raised tens of thousands of \ndollars, and recruited security experts and business associates. Smith made claims to others \ninvolved in the effort (and those from whom he sought funding) that he was in contact with hackers \nwith \u201cties and affiliations to Russia\u201d who had access to the emails, and that his efforts were \ncoordinated with the Trump Campaign.273 \nOn August 28, 2016, Smith sent an email from an encrypted account with the subject \u201cSec. \nClinton\u2019s unsecured private email server\u201d to an undisclosed list of recipients, including Campaign \nco-chairman Sam Clovis. The email stated that Smith was \u201c[j]ust finishing two days of sensitive \nmeetings here in DC with involved groups to poke and probe on the above. It is clear that the \nClinton\u2019s home-based, unprotected server was hacked with ease by both State-related players, and \nprivate mercenaries. Parties with varying interests, are circling to release ahead of the election.\u201d274 \nOn September 2, 2016, Smith directed a business associate to establish KLS Research LLC \nin furtherance of his search for the deleted Clinton emails.275 One of the purposes of KLS Research \nwas to manage the funds Smith raised in support of his initiative.276  KLS Research received over \n$30,000 during the presidential campaign, although Smith represented that he raised even more \nmoney.277 \nSmith recruited multiple people for his initiative, including security experts to search for \nand authenticate the emails.278 In early September 2016, as part of his recruitment and fundraising \neffort, Smith circulated a document stating that his initiative was \u201cin coordination\u201d with the Trump \nCampaign, \u201cto the extent permitted as an independent expenditure organization.\u201d279 The document \nlisted multiple individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign, including Flynn, Clovis, Bannon, \n271 12/3/15 Email, Smith to Szobocsan & Safron.  \n272 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 1. \n273 8/31/16 Email, Smith to Smith. \n274 8/28/16 Email, Smith to Smith.  \n275 Incorporation papers of KLS Research LLC, 7/26/17 \nSzobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 2. \n276 Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 3. \nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\n277 Financial Institution Record of Peter Smith \nPersonal Privacy\nand KLS Research LLC, 10/31/17 \n10/11/16 Email, Smith to \n278 Tait 8/22/17 302, at 3; York 7/12/17 302, at 1-2; York 11/22/17 302, at 1. \n279 York 7/13/17 302 (attachment KLS Research, LLC, \u201cClinton Email Reconnaissance Initiative,\u201d \nSept. 9, 2016). \n63 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nand Kellyanne Conway.280 The investigation established that Smith communicated with at least \nFlynn and Clovis about his search for the deleted Clinton emails,281 but the Office did not identify \nevidence that any of the listed individuals initiated or directed Smith\u2019s efforts.  \nIn September 2016, Smith and Ledeen got back in touch with each other about their \nrespective efforts. Ledeen wrote to Smith, \u201cwondering if you had some more detailed reports or \nmemos or other data you could share because we have come a long way in our efforts since we \nlast visited. . . . We would need as much technical discussion as possible so we could marry it \nagainst the new data we have found and then could share it back to you \u2018your eyes only.\u2019\u201d282 \nLedeen claimed to have obtained a trove of emails (from what she described as the \u201cdark \nweb\u201d) that purported to be the deleted Clinton emails. Ledeen wanted to authenticate the emails \nand solicited contributions to fund that effort.  Erik Prince provided funding to hire a tech advisor \nto ascertain the authenticity of the emails. According to Prince, the tech advisor determined that \nthe emails were not authentic.283 \nA backup of Smith\u2019s computer contained two files that had been downloaded from \nWikiLeaks and that were originally attached to emails received by John Podesta.  The files on \nSmith\u2019s computer had creation dates of October 2, 2016, which was prior to the date of their release \nby WikiLeaks.  Forensic examination, however, established that the creation date did not reflect \nwhen the files were downloaded to Smith\u2019s computer. (It appears the creation date was when \nWikiLeaks staged the document for release, as discussed in Volume I, Section III.B.3.c, supra.284) \nThe investigation did not otherwise identify evidence that Smith obtained the files before their \nrelease by WikiLeaks. \nSmith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton\u2019s deleted \nemails until shortly before the election. For example, on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there \nwas a \u201ctug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days,\u201d and \nthat WikiLeaks \u201chas maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this \nallows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8.\u201d285  An attachment to the \n280 \nThe \nsame \nrecruitment \ndocument \nlisted \nJerome \nCorsi \nunder \n\u201cIndependent \nGroups/Organizations/Individuals,\u201d and described him as an \u201cestablished author and writer from the right \non President Obama and Sec. Clinton.\u201d \n281 Flynn 11/29/17 302, at 7-8; 10/15/16 Email, Smith to Flynn et al.; 8/28/16 Email, Smith to Smith \n(bcc: Clovis et al.). \n282 9/16/16 Email, Ledeen to Smith.  \n283 Prince 4/4/18 302, at 4-5. \n284 The forensic analysis of Smith\u2019s computer devices found that Smith used an older Apple \noperating system that would have preserved that October 2, 2016 creation date when it was downloaded \n(no matter what day it was in fact downloaded by Smith). See Volume I, Section III.B.3.c, supra.  The \nOffice tested this theory in March 2019 by downloading the two files found on Smith\u2019s computer from \nWikiLeaks\u2019s site using the same Apple operating system on Smith\u2019s computer; both files were successfully \ndownloaded and retained the October 2, 2016 creation date.

The investigation also established that the  Trump  Campaign displayed \ninterest in the WikiLeaks releases, and that Harm to Ongoing Matter\n  As  \nexplained in Volume I, Section V.B, infra, the evidence was sufficient to support computer-\nintrusion (and  other)  charges against GRU officers for their role in election-related hacking.\n \n  \n \nInvestigative Technique\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\n  \n \n286 8/31/16 Email, Smith to Smith. \n287 Safron 3/20/18 302, at 3; Szobocsan 3/29/18 302, at 6. \n65 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME I \nThis report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.8(c), which \nstates that, \u201c[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel\u2019s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney \nGeneral a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special \nCounsel] reached.\u201d \nThe Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and \nsystematic fashion. Evidence of Russian government operations began to surface in mid-2016. In \nJune, the Democratic National Committee and its cyber response team publicly announced that \nRussian hackers had compromised its computer network. Releases of hacked materials\u2014hacks \nthat public reporting soon attributed to the Russian government\u2014began that same month. \nAdditional releases followed in July through the organization WikiLeaks, with further releases in \nOctober and November.     \nIn late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks\u2019s first release of stolen documents, a foreign \ngovernment contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy \nadvisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign \ngovernment that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that \nit could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to \nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July \n31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign \nwere coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. \nThat fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government \u201cdirected \nrecent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political \norganizations,\u201d and, \u201c[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election \nprocess.\u201d After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia \nfor having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were \nexamining Russia\u2019s interference in the election.    \nWithin the Executive Branch, these investigatory efforts ultimately led to the May 2017 \nappointment of Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III. The order appointing the Special Counsel \nauthorized him to investigate \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 \npresidential election,\u201d including any links or coordination between the Russian government and \nindividuals associated with the Trump Campaign.   \nAs set forth in detail in this report, the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation established that \nRussia interfered in the 2016 presidential election principally through two operations. First, a \nRussian entity carried out a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. \nTrump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Second, a Russian intelligence \nservice conducted computer-intrusion operations against entities, employees, and volunteers \nworking on the Clinton Campaign and then released stolen documents. The investigation also \nidentified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign. Although \nthe investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump \npresidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit \n1 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nelectorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not \nestablish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian \ngovernment in its election interference activities.  \n* * * \nBelow we describe the evidentiary considerations underpinning statements about the \nresults of our investigation and the Special Counsel\u2019s charging decisions, and we then provide an \noverview of the two volumes of our report.  \nThe report describes actions and events that the Special Counsel\u2019s Office found to be \nsupported by the evidence collected in our investigation. In some instances, the report points out \nthe absence of evidence or conflicts in the evidence about a particular fact or event.  In other \ninstances, when substantial, credible evidence enabled the Office to reach a conclusion with \nconfidence, the report states that the investigation established that certain actions or events \noccurred. A statement that the investigation did not establish particular facts does not mean there \nwas no evidence of those facts. \nIn evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted \na crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \u201ccollusion.\u201d In so doing, \nthe Office recognized that the word \u201ccollud[e]\u201d was used in communications with the Acting \nAttorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation\u2019s scope and that the term has \nfrequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific \noffense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal \ncriminal law. For those reasons, the Office\u2019s focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability \nwas on conspiracy as defined in federal law. In connection with that analysis, we addressed the \nfactual question whether members of the Trump Campaign \u201ccoordinat[ed]\u201d\u2014a term that appears \nin the appointment order\u2014with Russian election interference activities. \nLike collusion, \n\u201ccoordination\u201d does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood \ncoordination to require an agreement\u2014tacit or express\u2014between the Trump Campaign and the \nRussian government on election interference.  That requires more than the two parties taking \nactions that were informed by or responsive to the other\u2019s actions or interests.  We applied the term \ncoordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the \nTrump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities. \n* * * \nThe report on our investigation consists of two volumes: \nVolume I describes the factual results of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s \ninterference in the 2016 presidential election and its interactions with the Trump Campaign.  \nSection I describes the scope of the investigation. Sections II and III describe the principal ways \nRussia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Section IV describes links between the Russian \n2 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME I \nRUSSIAN SOCIAL  MEDIA  CAMPAIGN    \nThe Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference \noperations identified by the investigation\u2014a social media campaign designed to provoke and \namplify political and social discord in the United States. The IRA was based in St. Petersburg, \nRussia, and received funding from  Russian oligarch Yevgeniy Prigozhin and companies he  \ncontrolled. Prigozhin is widely reported to have ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, \nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nIn mid-2014, the IRA sent employees to the United States on an intelligence-gathering \nmission with instructions Harm to Ongoing Matter\nThe IRA later used social media accounts and interest groups to sow discord in the U.S. \npolitical system through what it termed \u201cinformation warfare.\u201d The campaign evolved from a \ngeneralized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a \ntargeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton. \nThe IRA\u2019s operation also included the purchase of political advertisements on social media in the \nnames of U.S. persons and entities, as well as the staging of political rallies inside the United \nStates. To organize those rallies, IRA employees posed as U.S. grassroots entities and persons and \nmade contact with Trump supporters and Trump Campaign officials in the United States. The \ninvestigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons conspired or coordinated with the \nIRA. Section II of this report details the Office\u2019s investigation of the Russian social media \ncampaign.   \nRUSSIAN HACKING OPERATIONS   \nAt the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in \nearly 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions \n(hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian \nintelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian \nArmy (GRU) carried out these operations.   \nIn March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign \nvolunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU \nhacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \n(DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).  The GRU stole hundreds of thousands \nof documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC \nannounced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government\u2019s role in hacking its network, the GRU \nbegan disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas \u201cDCLeaks\u201d and \n\u201cGuccifer 2.0.\u201d The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.   \n4 \n",

Around the  same time, candidate Trump  \nannounced that he hoped Russia would recover emails described as missing from  a  private server \nused by Clinton when she was Secretary of State (he later said that he was speaking sarcastically). \nWikiLeaks began releasing \nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nPodesta\u2019s stolen emails on October 7, 2016, less than one hour after a U.S. media outlet released \nvideo considered damaging to candidate Trump. Section III of this Report details the Office\u2019s \ninvestigation into the Russian hacking operations, as well as other efforts by Trump Campaign \nsupporters to obtain Clinton-related emails.      \nRUSSIAN CONTACTS WITH THE CAMPAIGN   \nThe social media campaign and the GRU hacking operations coincided with a series of \ncontacts between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.  \nThe Office investigated whether those contacts reflected or resulted in the Campaign conspiring \nor coordinating with Russia in its election-interference activities. Although the investigation \nestablished that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and \nworked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from \ninformation stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that \nmembers of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its \nelection interference activities. \nThe Russian contacts consisted of business connections, offers of assistance to the \nCampaign, invitations for candidate Trump and Putin to meet in person, invitations for Campaign \nofficials and representatives of the Russian government to meet, and policy positions seeking \nimproved U.S.-Russian relations. Section IV of this Report details the contacts between Russia \nand the Trump Campaign during the campaign and transition periods, the most salient of which \nare summarized below in chronological order. \n2015. Some of the earliest contacts were made in connection with a Trump Organization \nreal-estate project in Russia known as Trump Tower Moscow. Candidate Trump signed a Letter \nof Intent for Trump Tower Moscow by November 2015, and in January 2016 Trump Organization \nexecutive Michael Cohen emailed and spoke about the project with the office of Russian \ngovernment press secretary Dmitry Peskov. The Trump Organization pursued the project through \nat least June 2016, including by considering travel to Russia by Cohen and candidate Trump.   \nSpring 2016. Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos made early contact \nwith Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor who had connections to Russia and traveled to \nMoscow in April 2016. Immediately upon his return to London from that trip, Mifsud told \nPapadopoulos that the Russian government had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands \n5 \n",

One week later, in the first week of May 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a \nrepresentative of a foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from \nthe Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of \ninformation damaging to candidate Clinton. Throughout that period of time and for several months \nthereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals to arrange a meeting \nbetween the Campaign and the Russian government.  No meeting took place. \nSummer 2016. Russian outreach to the Trump Campaign continued into the summer of \n2016, as candidate Trump was becoming the presumptive Republican nominee for President.  On \nJune 9, 2016, for example, a Russian lawyer met with senior Trump Campaign officials Donald \nTrump Jr., Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort to deliver what the email \nproposing the meeting had described as \u201cofficial documents and information that would \nincriminate Hillary.\u201d The materials were offered to Trump Jr. as \u201cpart of Russia and its \ngovernment\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d The written communications setting up the meeting \nshowed that the Campaign anticipated receiving information from Russia that could assist \ncandidate Trump\u2019s electoral prospects, but the Russian lawyer\u2019s presentation did not provide such \ninformation.  \nDays after the June 9 meeting, on June 14, 2016, a cybersecurity firm and the DNC \nannounced that Russian government hackers had infiltrated the DNC and obtained access to \nopposition research on candidate Trump, among other documents. \nIn July 2016, Campaign foreign policy advisor Carter Page traveled in his personal capacity \nto Moscow and gave the keynote address at the New Economic School. Page had lived and worked \nin Russia between 2003 and 2007. After returning to the United States, Page became acquainted \nwith at least two Russian intelligence officers, one of whom was later charged in 2015 with \nconspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of Russia. Page\u2019s July 2016 trip to Moscow and his \nadvocacy for pro-Russian foreign policy drew media attention. The Campaign then distanced itself \nfrom Page and, by late September 2016, removed him from the Campaign.  \nJuly 2016 was also the month WikiLeaks first released emails stolen by the GRU from the \nDNC. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of internal DNC documents revealing \ninformation about the Clinton Campaign. Within days, there was public reporting that U.S. \nintelligence agencies had \u201chigh confidence\u201d that the Russian government was behind the theft of \nemails and documents from the DNC.  And within a week of the release, a foreign government \ninformed the FBI about its May 2016 interaction with Papadopoulos and his statement that the \nRussian government could assist the Trump Campaign. On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign \ngovernment reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the \nRussian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. \nSeparately, on August 2, 2016, Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort met in New York \nCity with his long-time business associate Konstantin Kilimnik, who the FBI assesses to have ties \nto Russian intelligence. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a peace plan for \nUkraine that Manafort acknowledged to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office was a \u201cbackdoor\u201d way for \nRussia to control part of eastern Ukraine; both men believed the plan would require candidate \nTrump\u2019s assent to succeed (were he to be elected President).

On October 7, 2016, the media released video of candidate Trump speaking in \ngraphic terms about women years earlier, which was considered damaging to his candidacy. Less \nthan an hour later, WikiLeaks made its second release: thousands of John Podesta\u2019s emails that \nhad been stolen by the GRU in late March 2016.  The FBI and other U.S. government institutions \nwere at the time continuing their investigation of suspected Russian government efforts to interfere \nin the presidential election. That same day, October 7, the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a joint public statement \u201cthat the Russian \nGovernment directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, \nincluding from US political organizations.\u201d Those \u201cthefts\u201d and the \u201cdisclosures\u201d of the hacked \nmaterials through online platforms such as WikiLeaks, the statement continued, \u201care intended to \ninterfere with the US election process.\u201d \nPost-2016 Election. Immediately after the November 8 election, Russian government \nofficials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new \nadministration. The most senior levels of the Russian government encouraged these efforts. The \nRussian Embassy made contact hours after the election to congratulate the President-Elect and to \narrange a call with President Putin. Several Russian businessmen picked up the effort from there.   \nKirill Dmitriev, the chief executive officer of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, was among \nthe Russians who tried to make contact with the incoming administration. In early December, a \nbusiness associate steered Dmitriev to Erik Prince, a supporter of the Trump Campaign and an \nassociate of senior Trump advisor Steve Bannon. Dmitriev and Prince later met face-to-face in \nJanuary 2017 in the Seychelles and discussed U.S.-Russia relations. During the same period, \nanother business associate introduced Dmitriev to a friend of Jared Kushner who had not served \non the Campaign or the Transition Team. Dmitriev and Kushner\u2019s friend collaborated on a short \nwritten reconciliation plan for the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev implied had been \ncleared through Putin. The friend gave that proposal to Kushner before the inauguration, and \nKushner later gave copies to Bannon and incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \nOn December 29, 2016, then-President Obama imposed sanctions on Russia for having \ninterfered in the election. Incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn called Russian \nAmbassador Sergey Kislyak and asked Russia not to escalate the situation in response to the \nsanctions. The following day, Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in \nresponse to the sanctions at that time. Hours later, President-Elect Trump tweeted, \u201cGreat move \non delay (by V. Putin).\u201d The next day, on December 31, 2016, Kislyak called Flynn and told him \nthe request had been received at the highest levels and Russia had chosen not to retaliate as a result \nof Flynn\u2019s request. \n* * * \nOn January 6, 2017, members of the intelligence community briefed President-Elect Trump \non a joint assessment\u2014drafted and coordinated among the Central Intelligence Agency, FBI, and \n7 \n",

A  \ndeclassified version of the assessment was publicly released that same day.     \nBetween mid-January 2017 and early February 2017, three congressional committees\u2014the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence (SSCI), and the Senate Judiciary Committee (SJC)\u2014announced that they would \nconduct inquiries, or had already been conducting inquiries, into Russian interference in the  \nelection. Then-FBI Director James Comey later confirmed to Congress the existence of the FBI\u2019s \ninvestigation into Russian interference that had begun before the election.  On March 20, 2017, in \nopen-session testimony before HPSCI, Comey stated: \nI have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm that the FBI, as part \nof our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government\u2019s efforts \nto interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and that includes investigating the \nnature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and \nthe Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the \ncampaign and Russia\u2019s efforts. . . . As with any counterintelligence investigation, \nthis will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.   \nThe investigation continued under then-Director Comey for the next seven weeks until May 9, \n2017, when President Trump fired Comey as FBI Director\u2014an action which is analyzed in \nVolume II of the report.  \nOn May 17, 2017, Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed the Special Counsel \nand authorized him to conduct the investigation that Comey had confirmed in his congressional \ntestimony, as well as matters arising directly from the investigation, and any other matters within \nthe scope of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a), which generally covers efforts to interfere with or obstruct the \ninvestigation. \nPresident Trump reacted negatively to the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment. He told advisors \nthat it was the end of his presidency, sought to have Attorney General Jefferson (Jeff) Sessions \nunrecuse from the Russia investigation and to have the Special Counsel removed, and engaged in \nefforts to curtail the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and prevent the disclosure of evidence to it, \nincluding through public and private contacts with potential witnesses.  Those and related actions \nare described and analyzed in Volume II of the report.  \n* * * \nTHE SPECIAL COUNSEL\u2019S CHARGING DECISIONS \nIn reaching the charging decisions described in Volume I of the report, the Office \ndetermined whether the conduct it found amounted to a violation of federal criminal law \nchargeable under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.000 et seq. \n(2018). The standard set forth in the Justice Manual is whether the conduct constitutes a crime; if \nso, whether admissible evidence would probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction; \n8 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nand whether prosecution would serve a substantial federal interest that could not be adequately \nserved by prosecution elsewhere or through non-criminal alternatives. See Justice Manual \u00a7 9-\n27.220. \nSection V of the report provides detailed explanations of the Office\u2019s charging decisions, \nwhich contain three main components. \nFirst, the Office determined that Russia\u2019s two principal interference operations in the 2016 \nU.S. presidential election\u2014the social media campaign and the hacking-and-dumping operations\u2014 \nviolated U.S. criminal law. Many of the individuals and entities involved in the social media \ncampaign have been charged with participating in a conspiracy to defraud the United States by \nundermining through deceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign \ninfluence in U.S. elections, as well as related counts of identity theft. See United States v. Internet \nResearch Agency, et al., No. 18-cr-32 (D.D.C.). Separately, Russian intelligence officers who \ncarried out the hacking into Democratic Party computers and the personal email accounts of \nindividuals affiliated with the Clinton Campaign conspired to violate, among other federal laws, \nthe federal computer-intrusion statute, and they  have been so charged.  See  United States  v.  \nNetyksho, et al., No. 18-cr-215 (D.D.C.).  Harm to Ongoing Matter\nPersonal Privacy\nSecond, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to \nthe Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was \nnot sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to \ncharge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian \nprincipal. And our evidence about the June 9, 2016 meeting and WikiLeaks\u2019s releases of hacked \nmaterials was not sufficient to charge a criminal campaign-finance violation. Further, the evidence \nwas not sufficient to charge that any member of the Trump Campaign conspired with \nrepresentatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.  \nThird, the investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump \nCampaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated \nindividuals and related matters. Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian \nelection interference. The Office charged some of those lies as violations of the federal false-\nstatements statute. Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about \nhis interactions with Russian Ambassador Kislyak during the transition period. \nGeorge \nPapadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor during the campaign period, pleaded guilty to lying to \ninvestigators about, inter alia, the nature and timing of his interactions with Joseph Mifsud, the \nprofessor who told Papadopoulos that the Russians had dirt on candidate Clinton in the form of \nthousands of emails.  Former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen pleaded  guilty to  \nmaking false statements to Congress about the Trump Moscow project.  \n \nHarm to Ongoing \nMatter\n And in February 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that  \n9 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nManafort lied to the Office and the grand jury concerning his interactions and communications \nwith Konstantin Kilimnik about Trump Campaign polling data and a peace plan for Ukraine.  \n* * * \nThe Office investigated several other events that have been publicly reported to involve \npotential Russia-related contacts. For example, the investigation established that interactions \nbetween Russian Ambassador Kislyak and Trump Campaign officials both at the candidate\u2019s April \n2016 foreign policy speech in Washington, D.C., and during the week of the Republican National \nConvention were brief, public, and non-substantive. And the investigation did not establish that \none Campaign official\u2019s efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing \nassistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia. \nThe \ninvestigation also did not establish that a meeting between Kislyak and Sessions in September \n2016 at Sessions\u2019s Senate office included any more than a passing mention of the presidential \ncampaign.  \nThe investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete \npicture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked \ntheir Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office\u2019s \njudgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other \nwitnesses and information\u2014such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be \nmembers of the media\u2014in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice \nManual \u00a7\u00a7 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was \npresumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \n\u201ctaint\u201d) team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes \nprovided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges \ndescribed above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as \nwell\u2014numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United \nStates. \nFurther, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct \nwe investigated\u2014including some associated with the Trump Campaign\u2014deleted relevant \ncommunications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature \nencryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records.  In \nsuch cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to \ncontemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared \ninconsistent with other known facts. \nAccordingly, while this report embodies factual and legal determinations that the Office \nbelieves to be accurate and complete to the greatest extent possible, given these identified gaps, \nthe Office cannot rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional \nlight on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.   \n10 \n",

First, \u201cas part of a \nfull and thorough investigation of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to interfere in the 2016 \npresidential election,\u201d the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate \u201cthe pertinent activities \nof Michael Cohen, Richard Gates,Personal Privacy\n  \n, Roger Stone, and\n \nPP\n \n\u201d  \u201cConfirmation of the authorization to investigate such individuals,\u201d the memorandum \nstressed, \u201cdoes not suggest that the Special Counsel has made a  determination that  any  of  them  has \ncommitted a crime.\u201d  Second, with respect to Michael Cohen,  the  memorandum  recognized the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s authority to investigate \u201cleads relate[d] to Cohen\u2019s establishment and use of \nEssential Consultants LLC to, inter alia, receive funds from  Russian-backed entities.\u201d  Third, the \nmemorandum  memorialized the Special Counsel\u2019s authority to investigate individuals and entities \nwho were possibly engaged in \u201cjointly undertaken activity\u201d with  existing subjects of the \ninvestigation, including Paul Manafort.  Finally, the memorandum  described an FBI investigation  \nopened before the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment into \u201callegations that [then-Attorney General  \nJeff Sessions] made false statements to the United States Senate[,]\u201d and confirmed the Special  \nCounsel\u2019s authority to investigate that matter.    \nThe Special Counsel structured the investigation in view of his power and authority \u201cto \nexercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions of any United States Attorney.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 600.6. Like a U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office considered a range of \nclassified and unclassified information available to the FBI in the course of the Office\u2019s Russia \ninvestigation, and the Office structured that work around evidence for possible use in prosecutions \nof federal crimes (assuming that one or more crimes were identified that warranted prosecution).  \nThere was substantial evidence immediately available to the Special Counsel at the inception of \nthe investigation in May 2017 because the FBI had, by that time, already investigated Russian \nelection interference for nearly 10 months. The Special Counsel\u2019s Office exercised its judgment \nregarding what to investigate and did not, for instance, investigate every public report of a contact \nbetween the Trump Campaign and Russian-affiliated individuals and entities.      \nThe Office has concluded its investigation into links and coordination between the Russian \ngovernment and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign. Certain proceedings associated \nwith the Office\u2019s work remain ongoing. After consultation with the Office of the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, the Office has transferred responsibility for those remaining issues to other components \nof the Department of Justice and FBI.  Appendix D lists those transfers.   \nTwo district courts confirmed the breadth of the Special Counsel\u2019s authority to investigate \nRussia election interference and links and/or coordination with the Trump Campaign.  See United \nStates v. Manafort, 312 F. Supp. 3d 60, 79-83 (D.D.C. 2018); United States v. Manafort, 321 F. \nSupp. 3d 640, 650-655 (E.D. Va. 2018). In the course of conducting that investigation, the Office \nperiodically identified evidence of potential criminal activity that was outside the scope of the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s authority established by the Acting Attorney General.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nthe Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Office referred that evidence to appropriate law \nenforcement authorities, principally other components of the Department of Justice and to the FBI.  \nAppendix D summarizes those referrals. \n* * * \nTo carry out the investigation and prosecution of the matters assigned to him, the Special \nCounsel assembled a team that at its high point included 19 attorneys\u2014five of whom joined the \nOffice from private practice and 14 on detail or assigned from other Department of Justice \ncomponents. These attorneys were assisted by a filter team of Department lawyers and FBI \npersonnel who screened materials obtained via court process for privileged information before \nturning those materials over to investigators; a support staff of three paralegals on detail from the \nDepartment\u2019s Antitrust Division; and an administrative staff of nine responsible for budget, \nfinance, purchasing, human resources, records, facilities, security, information technology, and \nadministrative support. The Special Counsel attorneys and support staff were co-located with and \nworked alongside approximately 40 FBI agents, intelligence analysts, forensic accountants, a \nparalegal, and professional staff assigned by the FBI to assist the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.  \nThose \u201cassigned\u201d FBI employees remained under FBI supervision at all times; the matters on \nwhich they assisted were supervised by the Special Counsel.1 \nDuring its investigation the Office issued more than 2,800 subpoenas under the auspices of \na grand jury sitting in the District of Columbia; executed nearly 500 search-and-seizure warrants; \nobtained more than 230 orders for communications records under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703(d); obtained \nalmost 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers; made 13 requests to foreign governments \npursuant to Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties; and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses, \nincluding almost 80 before a grand jury. \n* * * \nFrom its inception, the Office recognized that its investigation could identify foreign \nintelligence and counterintelligence information relevant to the FBI\u2019s broader national security \nmission. FBI personnel who assisted the Office established procedures to identify and convey \nsuch information to the FBI. The FBI\u2019s Counterintelligence Division met with the Office regularly \nfor that purpose for most of the Office\u2019s tenure. For more than the past year, the FBI also \nembedded personnel at the Office who did not work on the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, but \nwhose purpose was to review the results of the investigation and to send\u2014in writing\u2014summaries \nof foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information to FBIHQ and FBI Field Offices. \nThose communications and other correspondence between the Office and the FBI contain \ninformation derived from the investigation, not all of which is contained in this Volume. This \nVolume is a summary. It contains, in the Office\u2019s judgment, that information necessary to account \nfor the Special Counsel\u2019s prosecution and declination decisions and to describe the investigation\u2019s \nmain factual results.     \n1 FBI personnel assigned to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office were required to adhere to all applicable \nfederal law and all Department and FBI regulations, guidelines, and policies. An FBI attorney worked on \nFBI-related matters for the Office, such as FBI compliance with all FBI policies and procedures, including \nthe FBI\u2019s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide (DIOG). That FBI attorney worked under FBI \nlegal supervision, not the Special Counsel\u2019s supervision. \n13 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nINTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II \nThis report is submitted to the Attorney General pursuant to 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.8(c), which \nstates that, \u201c[a]t the conclusion of the Special Counsel\u2019s work, he . . . shall provide the Attorney \nGeneral a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions [the Special \nCounsel] reached.\u201d \nBeginning in 2017, the President of the United States took a variety of actions towards the \nongoing FBI investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and related \nmatters that raised questions about whether he had obstructed justice. The Order appointing the \nSpecial Counsel gave this Office jurisdiction to investigate matters that arose directly from the \nFBI\u2019s Russia investigation, including whether the President had obstructed justice in connection \nwith Russia-related investigations. The Special Counsel\u2019s jurisdiction also covered potentially \nobstructive acts related to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation itself.  This Volume of our report \nsummarizes our obstruction-of-justice investigation of the President.   \nWe first describe the considerations that guided our obstruction-of-justice investigation, \nand then provide an overview of this Volume:  \nFirst, a traditional prosecution or declination decision entails a binary determination to \ninitiate or decline a prosecution, but we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial \njudgment.  The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that \u201cthe indictment \nor criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the \nexecutive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions\u201d in violation of \u201cthe \nconstitutional separation of powers.\u201d1 Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the \nDepartment of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 515; \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC\u2019s legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising \nprosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC\u2019s constitutional view, we recognized that a federal \ncriminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President\u2019s capacity to \ngovern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.2 \nSecond, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, \nit recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President\u2019s term is permissible.3  The OLC \nopinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office.4 And if \nindividuals other than the President committed an obstruction offense, they may be prosecuted at \nthis time. Given those considerations, the facts known to us, and the strong public interest in \n1 A Sitting President\u2019s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, \n222, 260 (2000) (OLC Op.).  \n2 See U.S. CONST. Art. I \u00a7 2, cl. 5; \u00a7 3, cl. 6; cf. OLC Op. at 257-258 (discussing relationship \nbetween impeachment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President). \n3 OLC Op. at 257 n.36 (\u201cA grand jury could continue to gather evidence throughout the period of \nimmunity\u201d). \n4 OLC Op. at 255 (\u201cRecognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not \npreclude such prosecution once the President\u2019s term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by \nresignation or impeachment\u201d).    \n1 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nsafeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system, we conducted a thorough factual \ninvestigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary \nmaterials were available.   \nThird, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice \nManual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply \nan approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes. The \nthreshold step under the Justice Manual standards is to assess whether a person\u2019s conduct \n\u201cconstitutes a federal offense.\u201d U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220 (2018) (Justice \nManual). Fairness concerns counseled against potentially reaching that judgment when no charges \ncan be brought. The ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a \nspeedy and public trial, with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case. An \nindividual who believes he was wrongly accused can use that process to seek to clear his name.  In \ncontrast, a prosecutor\u2019s judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, \naffords no such adversarial opportunity for public name-clearing before an impartial adjudicator.5 \nThe concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case \nof a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor\u2019s accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, \ncould carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice.  OLC noted similar \nconcerns about sealed indictments. Even if an indictment were sealed during the President\u2019s term, \nOLC reasoned, \u201cit would be very difficult to preserve [an indictment\u2019s] secrecy,\u201d and if an \nindictment became public, \u201c[t]he stigma and opprobrium\u201d could imperil the President\u2019s ability to \ngovern.\u201d6  Although a prosecutor\u2019s internal report would not represent a formal public accusation \nakin to an indictment, the possibility of the report\u2019s public disclosure and the absence of a neutral \nadjudicatory forum to review its findings counseled against potentially determining \u201cthat the \nperson\u2019s conduct constitutes a federal offense.\u201d  Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.220.   \nFourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President \nclearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the \napplicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we \nobtained about the President\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from \nconclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does \nnot conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.   \n* \n* \n* \nThis report on our investigation consists of four parts. Section I provides an overview of \nobstruction-of-justice principles and summarizes certain investigatory and evidentiary \nconsiderations. Section II sets forth the factual results of our obstruction investigation and \nanalyzes the evidence.  Section III addresses statutory and constitutional defenses.  Section IV \nstates our conclusion. \n5 For that reason, criticisms have been lodged against the practice of naming unindicted co-\nconspirators in an indictment.  See United States v. Briggs, 514 F.2d 794, 802 (5th Cir. 1975) (\u201cThe courts \nhave struck down with strong language efforts by grand juries to accuse persons of crime while affording \nthem no forum in which to vindicate themselves.\u201d); see also Justice Manual \u00a7 9-11.130. \n6 OLC Op. at 259 & n.38 (citation omitted).  \n2 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY TO VOLUME II \nOur obstruction-of-justice inquiry focused on a series of actions by the President that \nrelated to the Russian-interference investigations, including the President\u2019s conduct towards the \nlaw enforcement officials overseeing the investigations and the witnesses to relevant events.   \nFACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION \nThe key issues and events we examined include the following: \nThe Campaign\u2019s response to reports about Russian support for Trump.  During the 2016 \npresidential campaign, questions arose about the Russian government\u2019s apparent support for \ncandidate Trump.  After WikiLeaks released politically damaging  Democratic Party emails that \nwere reported to have been hacked by Russia, Trump publicly expressed skepticism  that Russia \nwas responsible for the hacks at the same time  that he and other Campaign officials privately \nsought information Harm to Ongoing Matter\n \nabout any further planned WikiLeaks \nreleases. Trump also denied having any business in or connections to Russia, even though as late \nas June 2016 the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a  skyscraper to be \nbuilt in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow.  After the election,  the President expressed concerns \nto advisors that reports of Russia\u2019s election interference might lead the public to question the \nlegitimacy of his election.   \nConduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn. In mid-January 2017, \nincoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn falsely denied to the Vice President, other \nadministration officials, and FBI agents that he had talked to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \nabout Russia\u2019s response to U.S. sanctions on Russia for its election interference. On January 27, \nthe day after the President was told that Flynn had lied to the Vice President and had made similar \nstatements to the FBI, the President invited FBI Director Comey to a private dinner at the White \nHouse and told Comey that he needed loyalty. On February 14, the day after the President  \nrequested Flynn\u2019s resignation, the President told an outside advisor, \u201cNow that we fired Flynn, the \nRussia thing is over.\u201d The advisor disagreed and said the investigations would continue.   \nLater that afternoon, the President cleared the Oval Office to have a one-on-one meeting \nwith Comey. Referring to the FBI\u2019s investigation of Flynn, the President said, \u201cI hope you can \nsee your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this \ngo.\u201d Shortly after requesting Flynn\u2019s resignation and speaking privately to Comey, the President \nsought to have Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland draft an internal letter stating \nthat the President had not directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak. McFarland declined \nbecause she did not know whether that was true, and a White House Counsel\u2019s Office attorney \nthought that the request would look like a quid pro quo for an ambassadorship she had been offered.   \nThe President\u2019s reaction to the continuing Russia investigation. In February 2017, \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions began to assess whether he had to recuse himself from campaign-\nrelated investigations because of his role in the Trump Campaign. In early March, the President \ntold White House Counsel Donald McGahn to stop Sessions from recusing. And after Sessions \nannounced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at the decision and told advisors \nthat he should have an Attorney General who would protect him. That weekend, the President \ntook Sessions aside at an event and urged him to \u201cunrecuse.\u201d Later in March, Comey publicly \n3 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ndisclosed at a congressional hearing that the FBI was investigating \u201cthe Russian government\u2019s \nefforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d including any links or coordination between \nthe Russian government and the Trump Campaign. In the following days, the President reached \nout to the Director of National Intelligence and the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency \n(CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) to ask them what they could do to publicly dispel  \nthe suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort. \nThe President also twice called Comey directly, notwithstanding guidance from McGahn to avoid \ndirect contacts with the Department of Justice. Comey had previously assured the President that \nthe FBI was not investigating him personally, and the President asked Comey to \u201clift the cloud\u201d \nof the Russia investigation by saying that publicly.   \nThe President\u2019s termination of Comey. \nOn May 3, 2017, Comey testified in a \ncongressional hearing, but declined to answer questions about whether the President was \npersonally under investigation.   Within days, the President decided to terminate Comey. The \nPresident insisted that the termination letter, which was written for public release, state that Comey \nhad informed the President that he was not under investigation. The day of the firing, the White \nHouse maintained that Comey\u2019s termination resulted from independent recommendations from the \nAttorney General and Deputy Attorney General that Comey should be discharged for mishandling \nthe Hillary Clinton email investigation. But the President had decided to fire Comey before \nhearing from the Department of Justice. The day after firing Comey, the President told Russian \nofficials that he had \u201cfaced great pressure because of Russia,\u201d which had been \u201ctaken off\u201d by \nComey\u2019s firing. The next day, the President acknowledged in a television interview that he was \ngoing to fire Comey regardless of the Department of Justice\u2019s recommendation and that when he \n\u201cdecided to just do it,\u201d he was thinking that \u201cthis thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\u201d  \nIn response to a question about whether he was angry with Comey about the Russia investigation, \nthe President said, \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I want that thing to be absolutely done properly,\u201d \nadding that firing Comey \u201cmight even lengthen out the investigation.\u201d   \nThe appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him. On May 17, 2017, the \nActing Attorney General for the Russia investigation appointed a Special Counsel to conduct the \ninvestigation and related matters. The President reacted to news that a Special Counsel had been \nappointed by telling advisors that it was \u201cthe end of his presidency\u201d and demanding that Sessions \nresign. Sessions submitted his resignation, but the President ultimately did not accept it. The \nPresident told aides that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and suggested that the Special \nCounsel therefore could not serve. The President\u2019s advisors told him the asserted conflicts were \nmeritless and had already been considered by the Department of Justice.   \nOn June 14, 2017, the media reported that the Special Counsel\u2019s Office was investigating \nwhether the President had obstructed justice. Press reports called this \u201ca major turning point\u201d in \nthe investigation: while Comey had told the President he was not under investigation, following \nComey\u2019s firing, the President now was under investigation. The President reacted to this news \nwith a series of tweets criticizing the Department of Justice and the Special Counsel\u2019s \ninvestigation. On June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn at home and directed him to call \nthe Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be \nremoved. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather \nthan trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre.  \n4 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nEfforts to curtail the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. Two days after directing McGahn \nto have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of \nthe Russia investigation.   On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with \nhis former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and \ndictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions. The message said that Sessions should \npublicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation \nwas \u201cvery unfair\u201d to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to \nmeet with the Special Counsel and \u201clet [him] move forward with investigating election meddling \nfor future elections.\u201d Lewandowski said he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do.  \nOne month later, in another private meeting with Lewandowski on July 19, 2017, the \nPresident asked about the status of his message for Sessions to limit the Special Counsel \ninvestigation to future election interference. Lewandowski told the President that the message \nwould be delivered soon. Hours after that meeting, the President publicly criticized Sessions in an \ninterview with the New York Times, and then issued a series of tweets making it clear that \nSessions\u2019s job was in jeopardy. Lewandowski did not want to deliver the President\u2019s message \npersonally, so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions.  \nDearborn was uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.   \nEfforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence. In the summer of 2017, the President \nlearned that media outlets were asking questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower \nbetween senior campaign officials, including Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer who was \nsaid to be offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton as \u201cpart of Russia and its \ngovernment\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d On several occasions, the President directed aides not to \npublicly disclose the emails setting up the June 9 meeting, suggesting that the emails would not \nleak and that the number of lawyers with access to them should be limited. Before the emails \nbecame public, the President edited a press statement for Trump Jr. by deleting a line that \nacknowledged that the meeting was with \u201can individual who [Trump Jr.] was told might have \ninformation helpful to the campaign\u201d and instead said only that the meeting was about adoptions \nof Russian children. When the press asked questions about the President\u2019s involvement in Trump \nJr.\u2019s statement, the President\u2019s personal lawyer repeatedly denied the President had played any \nrole. \nFurther efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation.   In early \nsummer 2017, the President called Sessions at home and again asked him to reverse his recusal \nfrom the Russia investigation.  Sessions did not reverse his recusal. In October 2017, the President \nmet privately with Sessions in the Oval Office and asked him to \u201ctake [a] look\u201d at investigating \nClinton. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation \nagreement, the President met with Sessions in the Oval Office and suggested, according to notes \ntaken by a senior advisor, that if Sessions unrecused and took back supervision of the Russia \ninvestigation, he would be a \u201chero.\u201d The President told Sessions, \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything \nor direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.\u201d In response, Sessions volunteered \nthat he had never seen anything \u201cimproper\u201d on the campaign and told the President there was a \n\u201cwhole new leadership team\u201d in place. He did not unrecuse. \nEfforts to have McGahn deny that the President had ordered him to have the Special \nCounsel removed. In early 2018, the press reported that the President had directed McGahn to \n5 \n",

The President reacted to the news stories by directing White House \nofficials to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to \nhave the Special Counsel removed. McGahn told those officials that the media reports were  \naccurate in stating that the President had directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed.  \nThe President then met with McGahn in the Oval Office and again pressured him to deny the \nreports. In the same meeting, the President also asked McGahn why he had told the Special \nCounsel about the President\u2019s effort to remove the Special Counsel and why McGahn took notes \nof his conversations with the President. McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered \nhappening and perceived the President to be testing his mettle. \nConduct towards Flynn, Manafort, HOM\n. After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense \nagreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President\u2019s personal \ncounsel left a message for Flynn\u2019s attorneys reminding them of the President\u2019s warm feelings \ntowards Flynn, which he said \u201cstill remains,\u201d and asking for a \u201cheads up\u201d if Flynn knew \n\u201cinformation that implicates the President.\u201d  When Flynn\u2019s counsel reiterated that Flynn could no \nlonger share information pursuant to a joint defense agreement, the President\u2019s personal counsel \nsaid he would make sure that the President knew that Flynn\u2019s actions reflected \u201chostility\u201d towards \nthe President. During Manafort\u2019s prosecution and when the jury in his criminal trial was \ndeliberating, the President praised Manafort in public, said that Manafort was being treated \nunfairly, and declined to rule out a \nManafort \u201ca brave man\u201d for refusing to \u201cbreak\u201d and said that \u201cflipping\u201d \u201calmost ought to be  \npardon. After Manafort was convicted, the President called \noutlawed.\u201d Harm to Ongoing Matter\nConduct involving Michael Cohen. The President\u2019s conduct towards Michael Cohen, a \nformer Trump Organization executive, changed from praise for Cohen when he falsely minimized \nthe President\u2019s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project, to castigation of Cohen when \nhe became a cooperating witness. From September 2015 to June 2016, Cohen had pursued the \nTrump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization and had briefed candidate \nTrump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia \nto advance the deal. In 2017, Cohen provided false testimony to Congress about the project, \nincluding stating that he had only briefed Trump on the project three times and never discussed \ntravel to Russia with him, in an effort to adhere to a \u201cparty line\u201d that Cohen said was developed to \nminimize the President\u2019s connections to Russia. While preparing for his congressional testimony, \nCohen had extensive discussions with the President\u2019s personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, \nsaid that Cohen should \u201cstay on message\u201d and not contradict the President.  After the FBI searched \nCohen\u2019s home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not \n\u201cflip,\u201d contacted him directly to tell him to \u201cstay strong,\u201d and privately passed messages of support \nto him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President\u2019s personal counsel and believed that if \nhe stayed on message he would be taken care of. But after Cohen began cooperating with the \ngovernment in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a \u201crat,\u201d and \nsuggested that his family members had committed crimes. \n6 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nOverarching factual issues. We did not make a traditional prosecution decision about \nthese facts, but the evidence we obtained supports several general statements about the President\u2019s \nconduct. \nSeveral features of the conduct we investigated distinguish it from typical obstruction-of-\njustice cases. First, the investigation concerned the President, and some of his actions, such as \nfiring the FBI director, involved facially lawful acts within his Article II authority, which raises \nconstitutional issues discussed below.  At the same time, the President\u2019s position as the head of \nthe Executive Branch provided him with unique and powerful means of influencing official \nproceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses\u2014all of which is relevant to a potential \nobstruction-of-justice analysis.  Second, unlike cases in which a subject engages in obstruction of \njustice to cover up a crime, the evidence we obtained did not establish that the President was \ninvolved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference. Although the obstruction \nstatutes do not require proof of such a crime, the absence of that evidence affects the analysis of \nthe President\u2019s intent and requires consideration of other possible motives for his conduct.  Third, \nmany of the President\u2019s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of cooperation with \nthe government and suggestions of possible future pardons, took place in public view. That \ncircumstance is unusual, but no principle of law excludes public acts from the reach of the \nobstruction laws. If the likely effect of public acts is to influence witnesses or alter their testimony, \nthe harm to the justice system\u2019s integrity is the same.   \nAlthough the series of events we investigated involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of \nthe President\u2019s conduct towards the investigations can shed light on the nature of the President\u2019s \nacts and the inferences that can be drawn about his intent. In particular, the actions we investigated \ncan be divided into two phases, reflecting a possible shift in the President\u2019s motives. The first \nphase covered the period from the President\u2019s first interactions with Comey through the President\u2019s \nfiring of Comey.  During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally \nunder investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, \nhowever, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an \nobstruction-of-justice inquiry. At that point, the President engaged in a second phase of conduct, \ninvolving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both \npublic and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation. Judgments about \nthe nature of the President\u2019s motives during each phase would be informed by the totality of the \nevidence. \nSTATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL DEFENSES \nThe President\u2019s counsel raised statutory and constitutional defenses to a possible \nobstruction-of-justice analysis of the conduct we investigated. We concluded that none of those \nlegal defenses provided a basis for declining to investigate the facts.  \nStatutory defenses. Consistent with precedent and the Department of Justice\u2019s general \napproach to interpreting obstruction statutes, we concluded that several statutes could apply here.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1505, 1512(b)(3), 1512(c)(2). \nSection 1512(c)(2) is an omnibus \nobstruction-of-justice provision that covers a range of obstructive acts directed at pending or \ncontemplated official proceedings. No principle of statutory construction justifies narrowing the \nprovision to cover only conduct that impairs the integrity or availability of evidence. Sections \n1503 and 1505 also offer broad protection against obstructive acts directed at pending grand jury, \n7 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\njudicial, administrative, and congressional proceedings, and they are supplemented by a provision \nin Section 1512(b) aimed specifically at conduct intended to prevent or hinder the communication \nto law enforcement of information related to a federal crime.  \nConstitutional defenses. As for constitutional defenses arising from the President\u2019s status \nas the head of the Executive Branch, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the courts \nhave not definitively resolved these issues. We therefore examined those issues through the \nframework established by Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues. The \nDepartment of Justice and the President\u2019s personal counsel have recognized that the President is \nsubject to statutes that prohibit obstruction of justice by bribing a witness or suborning perjury \nbecause that conduct does not implicate his constitutional authority. With respect to whether the \nPresident can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the \nConstitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President\u2019s corrupt use of his \nauthority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice.   \nUnder applicable Supreme Court precedent, the Constitution does not categorically and \npermanently immunize a President for obstructing justice through the use of his Article II powers.  \nThe separation-of-powers doctrine authorizes Congress to protect official proceedings, including \nthose of courts and grand juries, from corrupt, obstructive acts regardless of their source. We also \nconcluded that any inroad on presidential authority that would occur from prohibiting corrupt acts \ndoes not undermine the President\u2019s ability to fulfill his constitutional mission. \nThe term \n\u201ccorruptly\u201d sets a demanding standard.  It requires a concrete showing that a person acted with an \nintent to obtain an improper advantage for himself or someone else, inconsistent with official duty \nand the rights of others. A preclusion of \u201ccorrupt\u201d official action does not diminish the President\u2019s \nability to exercise Article II powers. For example, the proper supervision of criminal law does not \ndemand freedom for the President to act with a corrupt intention of shielding himself from criminal \npunishment, avoiding financial liability, or preventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, \na statute that prohibits official action undertaken for such corrupt purposes furthers, rather than \nhinders, the impartial and evenhanded administration of the law.  It also aligns with the President\u2019s \nconstitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. Finally, we concluded that in the rare case in \nwhich a criminal investigation of the President\u2019s conduct is justified, inquiries to determine \nwhether the President acted for a corrupt motive should not impermissibly chill his performance \nof his constitutionally assigned duties. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction \nlaws to the President\u2019s corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law. \nCONCLUSION \nBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw \nultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct. \nThe evidence we obtained about the \nPresident\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were \nmaking a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a \nthorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, \nwe would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach \nthat judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a \ncrime, it also does not exonerate him.   \n8 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nI. BACKGROUND LEGAL AND EVIDENTIARY PRINCIPLES \nA. \nLegal Framework of Obstruction of Justice \nThe May 17, 2017 Appointment Order and the Special Counsel regulations provide this \nOffice with jurisdiction to investigate \u201cfederal crimes committed in the course of, and with intent \nto interfere with, the Special Counsel's investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, \ndestruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a). Because of that \ndescription of our jurisdiction, we sought evidence for our obstruction-of-justice investigation with \nthe elements of obstruction offenses in mind.  Our evidentiary analysis is similarly focused on the \nelements of such offenses, although we do not draw conclusions on the ultimate questions that \ngovern a prosecutorial decision under the Principles of Federal Prosecution. See Justice Manual \n\u00a7 9-27.000 et seq. (2018). \nHere, we summarize the law interpreting the elements of potentially relevant obstruction \nstatutes in an ordinary case. This discussion does not address the unique constitutional issues that \narise in an inquiry into official acts by the President.  Those issues are discussed in a later section \nof this report addressing constitutional defenses that the President\u2019s counsel have raised. See \nVolume II, Section III.B, infra. \nThree basic elements are common to most of the relevant obstruction statutes: (1) an \nobstructive act; (2) a nexus between the obstructive act and an official proceeding; and (3) a corrupt \nintent. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1505, 1512(c)(2). We describe those elements as they have \nbeen interpreted by the courts. We then discuss a more specific statute aimed at witness tampering, \nsee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b), and describe the requirements for attempted offenses and endeavors to \nobstruct justice, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, 1512(c)(2). \nObstructive act. Obstruction-of-justice law \u201creaches all corrupt conduct capable of \nproducing an effect that prevents justice from being duly administered, regardless of the means \nemployed.\u201d United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1393 (11th Cir. 1984) (interpreting 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1503). An \u201ceffort to influence\u201d a proceeding can qualify as an endeavor to obstruct \njustice even if the effort was \u201csubtle or circuitous\u201d and \u201chowever cleverly or with whatever \ncloaking of purpose\u201d it was made. United States v. Roe, 529 F.2d 629, 632 (4th Cir. 1975); see \nalso United States v. Quattrone, 441 F.3d 153, 173 (2d Cir. 2006). The verbs \u201c\u2018obstruct or impede\u2019 \nare broad\u201d and \u201ccan refer to anything that blocks, makes difficult, or hinders.\u201d Marinello v. United \nStates, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). \nAn improper motive can render an actor\u2019s conduct criminal even when the conduct would \notherwise be lawful and within the actor\u2019s authority. See United States v. Cueto, 151 F.3d 620, \n631 (7th Cir. 1998) (affirming obstruction conviction of a criminal defense attorney for \u201clitigation-\nrelated conduct\u201d); United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 992 (1st Cir. 1987) (\u201cany act by any \nparty\u2014whether lawful or unlawful on its face\u2014may abridge \u00a7 1503 if performed with a corrupt \nmotive\u201d). \nNexus to a pending or contemplated official proceeding. Obstruction-of-justice law \ngenerally requires a nexus, or connection, to an official proceeding. In Section 1503, the nexus \nmust be to pending \u201cjudicial or grand jury proceedings.\u201d United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, \n9 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n599 (1995). In Section 1505, the nexus can include a connection to a \u201cpending\u201d federal agency \nproceeding or a congressional inquiry or investigation. Under both statutes, the government must \ndemonstrate \u201ca relationship in time, causation, or logic\u201d between the obstructive act and the \nproceeding or inquiry to be obstructed. Id. at 599; see also Arthur Andersen LLP v. United States, \n544 U.S. 696, 707-708 (2005). Section 1512(c) prohibits obstructive efforts aimed at official \nproceedings including judicial or grand jury proceedings. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(a)(1)(A). \u201cFor \npurposes of\u201d Section 1512, \u201can official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted \nat the time of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(f)(1). Although a proceeding need not already be in \nprogress to trigger liability under Section 1512(c), a nexus to a contemplated proceeding still must \nbe shown. United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); United States v. Petruk, 781 \nF.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d 1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); \nUnited States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007). The nexus requirement narrows the \nscope of obstruction statutes to ensure that individuals have \u201cfair warning\u201d of what the law  \nproscribes. Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe nexus showing has subjective and objective components. As an objective matter, a \ndefendant must act \u201cin a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,\u201d such that the statute \u201cexcludes \ndefendants who have an evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably \nbe successful.\u201d Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  \n\u201c[T]he endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due \nadministration of justice.\u201d Id. at 599 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \nAs a \nsubjective matter, the actor must have \u201ccontemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.\u201d \nPetruk, 781 F.3d at 445-446. A defendant need not directly impede the proceeding. Rather, a \nnexus exists if \u201cdiscretionary actions of a third person would be required to obstruct the judicial \nproceeding if it was foreseeable to the defendant that the third party would act on the [defendant\u2019s] \ncommunication in such a way as to obstruct the judicial proceeding.\u201d United States v. Martinez, \n862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. 2017) (brackets, ellipses, and internal quotation marks omitted).   \nCorruptly. The word \u201ccorruptly\u201d provides the intent element for obstruction of justice and \nmeans acting \u201cknowingly and dishonestly\u201d or \u201cwith an improper motive.\u201d United States v. \nRichardson, 676 F.3d 491, 508 (5th Cir. 2012); United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 \n(10th Cir. 2013) (to act corruptly means to \u201cact[] with an improper purpose and to engage in \nconduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, impede or obstruct\u201d the \nrelevant proceeding) (some quotation marks omitted); see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(b) (\u201cAs used in section \n1505, the term \u2018corruptly\u2019 means acting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing \nanother.\u201d); see also Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (interpreting \u201ccorruptly\u201d to mean \n\u201cwrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil\u201d and holding that acting \u201cknowingly . . . corruptly\u201d in 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b) requires \u201cconsciousness of wrongdoing\u201d).

Corrupt persuasion is shown \u201cwhere a \ndefendant tells a potential witness a false story as if the story were true, intending that the witness \nbelieve the story and testify to it.\u201d United States v. Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 82 (2d Cir. 1986); see \nUnited States v. Gabriel, 125 F.3d 89, 102 (2d Cir. 1997). It also covers urging a witness to recall \na fact that the witness did not know, even if the fact was actually true. See LaShay, 417 F.3d at \n719. Corrupt persuasion also can be shown in certain circumstances when a person, with an \nimproper motive, urges a witness not to cooperate with law enforcement.  See United States v. \nShotts, 145 F.3d 1289, 1301 (11th Cr. 1998) (telling Secretary \u201cnot to [say] anything [to the FBI] \nand [she] would not be bothered\u201d). \nWhen the charge is acting with the intent to hinder, delay, or prevent the communication \nof information to law enforcement under Section 1512(b)(3), the \u201cnexus\u201d to a proceeding inquiry \narticulated in Aguilar\u2014that an individual have \u201cknowledge that his actions are likely to affect the \njudicial proceeding,\u201d 515 U.S. at 599\u2014does not apply because the obstructive act is aimed at the \ncommunication of information to investigators, not at impeding an official proceeding.   \nActing \u201cknowingly . . . corruptly\u201d requires proof that the individual was \u201cconscious of \nwrongdoing.\u201d Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 705-706 (declining to explore \u201c[t]he outer limits of \nthis element\u201d but indicating that an instruction was infirm where it permitted conviction even if \nthe defendant \u201chonestly and sincerely believed that [the] conduct was lawful\u201d).  It is an affirmative \ndefense that \u201cthe conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendant\u2019s sole intention \nwas to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.\u201d  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(e). \nAttempts and endeavors. Section 1512(c)(2) covers both substantive obstruction offenses \nand attempts to obstruct justice. Under general principles of attempt law, a person is guilty of an \nattempt when he has the intent to commit a substantive offense and takes an overt act that \nconstitutes a substantial step towards that goal. See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. \n102, 106-107 (2007). \u201c[T]he act [must be] substantial, in that it was strongly corroborative of the \ndefendant\u2019s criminal purpose.\u201d United States v. Pratt, 351 F.3d 131, 135 (4th Cir. 2003). While \n\u201cmere abstract talk\u201d does not suffice, any \u201cconcrete and specific\u201d acts that corroborate the \ndefendant\u2019s intent can constitute a \u201csubstantial step.\u201d United States v. Irving, 665 F.3d 1184, 1198-\n1205 (10th Cir. 2011). Thus, \u201csoliciting an innocent agent to engage in conduct constituting an \nelement of the crime\u201d may qualify as a substantial step. Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.01(2)(g); see United \nStates v. Lucas, 499 F.3d 769, 781 (8th Cir. 2007). \n11 \n",

See United States v. Sampson, 898 \nF.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th Cir. 1988) \n(collecting cases). \u201cIt is well established that a[n] [obstruction-of-justice] offense is complete \nwhen one corruptly endeavors to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice; the \nprosecution need not prove that the due administration of justice was actually obstructed or \nimpeded.\u201d United States v.

We therefore requested that the White House provide us with documentary \nevidence in its possession on the relevant events.

These investigative steps \nallowed us to gather a substantial amount of evidence.    \nWe also sought a voluntary interview with the President. After more than a year of \ndiscussion, the President declined to be interviewed. Grand Jury\n \nDuring the course of our discussions, \nthe President did agree to answer  written questions on certain Russia-related topics, and he \nprovided us with answers.  He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on \nobstruction topics or questions on events during the transition.  Ultimately,  while we believed that  \nwe had the authority and  legal justification  to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the President\u2019s \ntestimony, we chose not to do so.  We made that decision in view of the substantial delay that such \nan investigative step  would likely  produce at a  late stage in  our investigation.   We also assessed  \nthat based on the significant body of evidence we had already obtained of the President\u2019s actions \nand his public and private statements describing or explaining those actions, we had sufficient \nevidence to understand relevant events and to make certain assessments without the President\u2019s \ntestimony.  The Office\u2019s decision-making process on this issue is described in more detail in \nAppendix C, infra, in a note that precedes the President\u2019s written responses.   \nIn assessing the evidence we obtained, we relied on common principles that apply in any \ninvestigation. The issue of criminal intent is often inferred from circumstantial evidence. See, \ne.g., United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2016) (\u201c[G]uilty knowledge can \nrarely be established by direct evidence. . . . Therefore, mens rea elements such as knowledge or \nintent may be proved by circumstantial evidence.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); United \nStates v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 36 (2d Cir. 2012) (\u201cThe government\u2019s case rested on \ncircumstantial evidence, but the mens rea elements of knowledge and intent can often be proved \nthrough circumstantial evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). The principle that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence \nis a necessity in criminal cases, given the right of a subject to assert his privilege against compelled \nself-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment and therefore decline to testify. Accordingly, \ndeterminations on intent are frequently reached without the opportunity to interview an \ninvestigatory subject. \nObstruction-of-justice cases are consistent with this rule. See, e.g., Edlind, 887 F.3d at \n174, 176 (relying on \u201csignificant circumstantial evidence that [the defendant] was conscious of her \nwrongdoing\u201d in an obstruction case; \u201c[b]ecause evidence of intent will almost always be \ncircumstantial, a defendant may be found culpable where the reasonable and foreseeable \nconsequences of her acts are the obstruction of justice\u201d) (internal quotation marks, ellipses, and \npunctuation omitted); Quattrone, 441 F.3d at 173-174. Circumstantial evidence that illuminates \nintent may include a pattern of potentially obstructive acts. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (\u201cEvidence of a \ncrime, wrong, or other act . . . may be admissible  . . . [to] prov[e] motive, opportunity, intent, \npreparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\u201d); see, e.g., United \nStates v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648-650 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Arnold, 773 F.2d \n823, 832-834 (7th Cir. 1985); Cintolo, 818 F.2d at 1000. \nCredibility judgments may also be made based on objective facts and circumstantial \nevidence. Standard jury instructions highlight a variety of factors that are often relevant in \n13 \n",

P. 6(e)\nassessing credibility. These include whether a witness had a reason not to tell the truth; whether \nthe witness had a good memory; whether the witness had the opportunity to observe the events \nabout which he testified; whether the witness\u2019s testimony was corroborated by other witnesses; \nand whether anything the witness said or wrote previously contradicts his testimony. See, e.g., \nFirst Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 1.06 (2018); Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions \n(Criminal Cases) \u00a7 1.08 (2012); Seventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction \u00a7 3.01 (2012). \nIn addition to those general factors, we took into account more specific factors in assessing \nthe credibility of conflicting accounts of the facts. For example, contemporaneous written notes \ncan provide strong corroborating evidence. See United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 232 (1975) \n(the fact that a \u201cstatement appeared in the contemporaneously recorded report . . . would tend \nstrongly to corroborate the investigator\u2019s version of the interview\u201d). Similarly, a witness\u2019s \nrecitation of his account before he had any motive to fabricate also supports the witness\u2019s \ncredibility. See Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150, 158 (1995) (\u201cA consistent statement that \npredates the motive is a square rebuttal of the charge that the testimony was contrived as a \nconsequence of that motive.\u201d). Finally, a witness\u2019s false description of an encounter can imply \nconsciousness of wrongdoing. See Al-Adahi v. Obama, 613 F.3d 1102, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \n(noting the \u201cwell-settled principle that false exculpatory statements are evidence\u2014often strong \nevidence\u2014of guilt\u201d).  We applied those settled legal principles in evaluating the factual results of \nour investigation. \n14 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nII. FACTUAL RESULTS OF THE OBSTRUCTION INVESTIGATION \nThis section of the report details the evidence we obtained. We first provide an overview \nof how Russia became an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign, and how candidate Trump \nresponded. We then turn to the key events that we investigated: the President\u2019s conduct concerning \nthe FBI investigation of Michael Flynn; the President\u2019s reaction to public confirmation of the FBI\u2019s \nRussia investigation; events leading up to and surrounding the termination of FBI Director Comey; \nefforts to terminate the Special Counsel; efforts to curtail the scope of the Special Counsel\u2019s \ninvestigation; efforts to prevent disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower \nmeeting between Russians and senior campaign officials; efforts to have the Attorney General \nunrecuse; and conduct towards McGahn, Cohen, and other witnesses.   \nWe summarize the evidence we found and then analyze it by reference to the three statutory \nobstruction-of-justice elements: obstructive act, nexus to a proceeding, and intent. We focus on \nelements because, by regulation, the Special Counsel has \u201cjurisdiction . . . to investigate . . . federal \ncrimes committed in the course of, and with intent to interfere with, the Special Counsel\u2019s \ninvestigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of \nwitnesses.\u201d \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4(a). \nConsistent with our jurisdiction to investigate federal \nobstruction crimes, we gathered evidence that is relevant to the elements of those crimes and \nanalyzed them within an elements framework\u2014while refraining from reaching ultimate \nconclusions about whether crimes were committed, for the reasons explained above.  This section \nalso does not address legal and constitutional defenses raised by counsel for the President; those \ndefenses are analyzed in Volume II, Section III, infra. \nA. \nThe Campaign\u2019s Response to Reports About Russian Support for Trump \nDuring the 2016 campaign, the media raised questions about a possible connection between \nthe Trump Campaign and Russia.7 The questions intensified after WikiLeaks released politically \ndamaging Democratic Party emails that were reported to have been hacked by Russia. Trump \nresponded to questions about possible connections to Russia by denying any business involvement \nin Russia\u2014even though the Trump Organization had pursued a business project in Russia as late \nas June 2016. Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the \nHOM\nemails at the same \ntime as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information \nabout any \nfurther planned WikiLeaks releases. After the election, when questions persisted about possible \nlinks between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to deny any \nconnections to Russia and privately expressed concerns that reports of Russian election \ninterference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election.8 \n7 This section summarizes and cites various news stories not for the truth of the information \ncontained in the stories, but rather to place candidate Trump\u2019s response to those stories in context. Volume \nI of this report analyzes the underlying facts of several relevant events that were reported on by the media \nduring the campaign. \n8 As discussed in Volume I, while the investigation identified numerous links between individuals \nwith ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence \nwas not sufficient to charge that any  member of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with \nrepresentatives of the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.  \n15 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n1. Press Reports Allege Links Between the Trump Campaign and Russia  \nOn June 16, 2015, Donald J. Trump declared his intent to seek nomination as the \nRepublican candidate for President.9 By early 2016, he distinguished himself among Republican \ncandidates by speaking of closer ties with Russia,10 saying he would get along well with Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin,11 questioning whether the NATO alliance was obsolete,12 and praising \nPutin as a \u201cstrong leader.\u201d13 The press reported that Russian political analysts and commentators \nperceived Trump as favorable to Russia.14 \nBeginning in February 2016 and continuing through the summer, the media reported that \nseveral Trump campaign advisors appeared to have ties to Russia. For example, the press reported \nthat campaign advisor Michael Flynn was seated next to Vladimir Putin at an RT gala in Moscow \nin December 2015 and that Flynn had appeared regularly on RT as an analyst.15  The press also \nreported that foreign policy advisor Carter Page had ties to a Russian state-run gas company,16 and \nthat campaign chairman Paul Manafort had done work for the \u201cRussian-backed former Ukrainian \npresident Viktor Yanukovych.\u201d17 In addition, the press raised questions during the Republican \n9 @realDonaldTrump 6/16/15 (11:57 a.m. ET) Tweet. \n10 See, e.g., Meet the Press Interview with Donald J. Trump, NBC (Dec. 20, 2015) (Trump: \u201cI think \nit would be a positive thing if Russia and the United States actually got along\u201d); Presidential Candidate \nDonald Trump News Conference, Hanahan, South Carolina, C-SPAN (Feb. 15, 2016) (\u201cYou want to make \na good deal for the country, you want to deal with Russia.\u201d). \n11 See, e.g., Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees, CNN (July 8, 2015) (\u201cI think I get along with [Putin] \nfine.\u201d); Andrew Rafferty, Trump Says He Would \u201cGet Along Very Well\u201d With Putin, NBC (July 30, 2015) \n(quoting Trump as saying, \u201cI think I would get along very well with Vladimir Putin.\u201d). \n12 See, e.g., @realDonaldTrump Tweet 3/24/16 (7:47 a.m. ET); @realDonaldTrump Tweet 3/24/16 \n(7:59 a.m. ET). \n13 See, e.g., Meet the Press Interview with Donald J. Trump, NBC (Dec. 20, 2015) (\u201c[Putin] is a \nstrong leader. What am I gonna say, he\u2019s a weak leader?  He\u2019s making mincemeat out of our President.\u201d); \nDonald Trump Campaign Rally in Vandalia, Ohio, C-SPAN (Mar. 12, 2016) (\u201cI said [Putin] was a strong \nleader, which he is. I mean, he might be bad, he might be good. But he\u2019s a strong leader.\u201d). \n14 See, e.g., Andrew Osborn, From Russia with love: why the Kremlin backs Trump, Reuters (Mar. \n24, 2016); Robert Zubrin, Trump: The Kremlin\u2019s Candidate, National Review (Apr. 4, 2016).  \n15 See, e.g., Mark Hosenball & Steve Holland, Trump being advised by ex-U.S. Lieutenant General \nwho favors closer Russia ties, Reuters (Feb. 26, 2016); Tom Hamburger et al., Inside Trump\u2019s financial ties \nto Russia and his unusual flattery of Vladimir Putin, Washington Post (June 17, 2016).

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nB. \nThe President\u2019s Conduct Concerning the Investigation of Michael Flynn \nOverview \nDuring the presidential transition, incoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn had \ntwo phone calls with the Russian Ambassador to the United States about the Russian response to \nU.S. sanctions imposed because of Russia\u2019s election interference. After the press reported on \nFlynn\u2019s contacts with the Russian Ambassador, Flynn lied to incoming Administration officials \nby saying he had not discussed sanctions on the calls. The officials publicly repeated those lies in \npress interviews. \nThe FBI, which previously was investigating Flynn for other matters, \ninterviewed him about the calls in the first week after the inauguration, and Flynn told similar lies \nto the FBI. On January 26, 2017, Department of Justice (DOJ) officials notified the White House \nthat Flynn and the Russian Ambassador had discussed sanctions and that Flynn had been \ninterviewed by the FBI. The next night, the President had a private dinner with FBI Director James \nComey in which he asked for Comey\u2019s loyalty.  On February 13, 2017, the President asked Flynn \nto resign. The following day, the President had a one-on-one conversation with Comey in which \nhe said, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.\u201d \nEvidence \n1. Incoming National Security Advisor Flynn Discusses Sanctions on Russia with \nRussian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak \nShortly after the election, President-Elect Trump announced he would appoint Michael \nFlynn as his National Security Advisor.78 For the next two months, Flynn played an active role on \nthe Presidential Transition Team (PTT) coordinating policy positions and communicating with \nforeign government officials, including Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey \nKislyak.79 \nOn December 29, 2016, as noted in Volume II, Section II.A.4, supra, the Obama \nAdministration announced that it was imposing sanctions and other measures on several Russian \nindividuals and entities.80   That day, multiple members of the PTT exchanged emails about the \nsanctions and the impact they would have on the incoming Administration, and Flynn informed \nmembers of the PTT that he would be speaking to the Russian Ambassador later in the day.81 \n78 Flynn 11/16/17 302, at 7; President-Elect Donald J.

On January 23, 2017, Spicer delivered his first press briefing and stated \nthat he had spoken with Flynn the night before, who confirmed that the calls with Kislyak were \nabout topics unrelated to sanctions.137 Spicer\u2019s statements added to the Department of Justice\u2019s \nconcerns that Russia had leverage over Flynn based on his lies and could use that derogatory \ninformation to compromise him.138 \nOn January 24, 2017, Flynn agreed to be interviewed by agents from the FBI.139  During \nthe interview, which took place at the White House, Flynn falsely stated that he did not ask Kislyak \nto refrain from escalating the situation in response to the sanctions on Russia imposed by the \nObama Administration.140 \nFlynn also falsely stated that he did not remember a follow-up \nconversation in which Kislyak stated that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those \nsanctions as a result of Flynn\u2019s request.141 \n133 Face the Nation Interview with Vice President-Elect Pence, CBS (Jan. 15, 2017); Julie \nHirschfield Davis et al., Trump National Security Advisor Called Russian Envoy Day Before Sanctions \nWere Imposed, Washington Post (Jan. 13, 2017); Meet the Press Interview with Reince Priebus, NBC (Jan. \n15, 2017). \n134 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 2-3; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 3-4; McCabe 8/17/17 302, at 5 (DOJ officials \nwere \u201creally freaked out about it\u201d). \n135 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 3; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 4. \n136 McCord 7/17/17 302, at 4; McCabe 8/17/17 302, at 5-6.  \n137 Sean Spicer, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (Jan. 23, 2017). \n138 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 4; Axelrod 7/20/17 302, at 5. \n139 Flynn Statement of Offense, at 2. \n140 Flynn Statement of Offense, at 2. \n141 Flynn Statement of Offense, at 2.

DOJ Officials Notify the White House of Their Concerns About Flynn  \nOn January 26, 2017, Acting Attorney General Sally Yates contacted White House Counsel \nDonald McGahn and informed him that she needed to discuss a sensitive matter with him in \nperson.142 Later that day, Yates and Mary McCord, a senior national security official at the \nDepartment of Justice, met at the White House with McGahn and White House Counsel\u2019s Office \nattorney James Burnham.143 Yates said that the public statements made by the Vice President \ndenying that Flynn and Kislyak discussed sanctions were not true and put Flynn in a potentially \ncompromised position because the Russians would know he had lied.144  Yates disclosed that Flynn \nhad been interviewed by the FBI.145 She declined to answer a specific question about how Flynn \nhad performed during that interview,146 but she indicated that Flynn\u2019s statements to the FBI were \nsimilar to the statements he had made to Pence and Spicer denying that he had discussed  \nsanctions.147  McGahn came away from the meeting with the impression that the FBI had not \npinned Flynn down in lies,148 but he asked John Eisenberg, who served as legal advisor to the \nNational Security Council, to examine potential legal issues raised by Flynn\u2019s FBI interview and \nhis contacts with Kislyak.149 \nThat afternoon, McGahn notified the President that Yates had come to the White House to \ndiscuss concerns about Flynn.150 McGahn described what Yates had told him, and the President \nasked him to repeat it, so he did.151 McGahn recalled that when he described the FBI interview of \nFlynn, he said that Flynn did not disclose having discussed sanctions with Kislyak, but that there \nmay not have been a clear violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.152 The President asked about Section \n1001, and McGahn explained the law to him, and also explained the Logan Act.153  The President \n142 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 6. \n143 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 6; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 6; SCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft \nMemorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). \n144 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 6-8; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 6-7; Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 4; \nSCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). \n145 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 5; Yates 8/15/17 302, at 7; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 7; Burnham \n11/3/17 302, at 4. \n146 Yates 8/15/17 302, at 7; McCord 7/17/17 302, at 7. \n147 SCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the \nPresident); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 4. \n148 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 5. \n149 SCR015_000198 (2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the \nPresident); McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 6, 8. \n150 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 6; SCR015_000278 (White House Counsel\u2019s Office Memorandum \nre: \u201cFlynn Tick Tock\u201d) (on January 26, \u201cMcGahn IMMEDIATELY advises POTUS\u201d); SCR015_000198 \n(2/15/17 Draft Memorandum to file from the Office of the Counsel to the President). \n151 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 6. \n152 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 7. \n153 McGahn 11/30/17 302, at 7. \n31 \n",

Flynn\u2019s Resignation \nOn February 2, 2017, Eisenberg reviewed the underlying information relating to Flynn\u2019s \ncalls with Kislyak.189 Eisenberg recalled that he prepared a memorandum about criminal statutes \nthat could apply to Flynn\u2019s conduct, but he did not believe the White House had enough \ninformation to make a definitive recommendation to the President.190 Eisenberg and McGahn \ndiscussed that Eisenberg\u2019s review of the underlying information confirmed his preliminary  \nconclusion that Flynn was unlikely to be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act.191 Because White \nHouse officials were uncertain what Flynn had told the FBI, however, they could not assess his \nexposure to prosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.192 \nThe week of February 6, Flynn had a one-on-one conversation with the President in the \nOval Office about the negative media coverage of his contacts with Kislyak.193 Flynn recalled that \nthe President was upset and asked him for information on the conversations.194 Flynn listed the \nspecific dates on which he remembered speaking with Kislyak, but the President corrected one of \nthe dates he listed.195  The President asked Flynn what  he and Kislyak discussed  and  Flynn \nresponded that he might have talked about sanctions.196 \nmemorandum documenting the dinner to his senior leadership team, and McCabe confirmed that the \nmemorandum captured what Comey said on the telephone call immediately following the dinner.

For example, Comey recalled, and his memoranda reflect, \nthat he told the President in his January 6, 2017 meeting, and on phone calls on March 30 and April 11, \n2017, that the FBI was not investigating the President personally. On May 8, 2017, during White House \ndiscussions about firing Comey, the President told Rosenstein and others that Comey had told him three \ntimes that he was not under investigation, including once in person and twice on the phone.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nOn February 9, 2017, the Washington Post reported that Flynn discussed sanctions with \nKislyak the month before the President took office.197 After the publication of that story, Vice \nPresident Pence learned of the Department of Justice\u2019s notification to the White House about the \ncontent of Flynn\u2019s calls.198 He and other advisors then sought access to and reviewed the \nunderlying information about Flynn\u2019s contacts with Kislyak.199 FBI Deputy Director Andrew \nMcCabe, who provided the White House officials access to the information and was present when \nthey reviewed it, recalled the officials asking him whether Flynn\u2019s conduct violated the Logan \nAct.200 McCabe responded that he did not know, but the FBI was investigating the matter because \nit was a possibility.201 Based on the evidence of Flynn\u2019s contacts with Kislyak, McGahn and \nPriebus concluded that Flynn could not have forgotten the details of the discussions of sanctions \nand had instead been lying about what he discussed with Kislyak.202 Flynn had also told White \nHouse officials that the FBI had told him that the FBI was closing out its investigation of him,203 \nbut Eisenberg did not believe him.204 After reviewing the materials and speaking with Flynn, \nMcGahn and Priebus concluded that Flynn should be terminated and recommended that course of \naction to the President.205 \nThat weekend, Flynn accompanied the President to Mar-a-Lago.206 Flynn recalled that on \nFebruary 12, 2017, on the return flight to D.C. on Air Force One, the President asked him whether \nhe had lied to the Vice President.207 Flynn responded that he may have forgotten details of his \ncalls, but he did not think he lied.208  The President responded, \u201cOkay.

It\u2019s over.\u201d219 Christie recalled \nresponding that based on his experience both as a prosecutor and as someone who had been \ninvestigated, firing Flynn would not end the investigation.220  Christie said there was no way to \nmake an investigation shorter, but a lot of ways to make it longer.221  The President asked Christie \nwhat he meant, and Christie told the President not to talk about the investigation even if he was \n210 Priebus 1/18/18 302, at 9. \n211 Priebus 1/18/18 302, at 9; Flynn 11/17/17 302, at 10. \n212 Priebus 1/18/18 302, at 9; Flynn 11/17/17 302, at 10. \n213 SCR004_00600 (2/16/17 Email, Burnham to Donaldson). \n214 Sean Spicer, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (Feb. 14, 2017).  After Flynn pleaded guilty \nto violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in December 2017, the President tweeted, \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because \nhe lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\u201d  @realDonaldTrump 12/2/17 (12:14 p.m. ET) Tweet.  The next \nday, the President\u2019s personal counsel told the press that he had drafted the tweet. Maegan Vazquez et al., \nTrump\u2019s lawyer says he was behind President\u2019s tweet about firing Flynn, CNN (Dec. 3, 2017). \n215 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 2-3; SCR012b_000022 (President\u2019s Daily Diary, 2/14/17). \n216 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 3. \n217 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 3. \n218 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 3. Christie said he thought when the President said \u201cthe Russia thing\u201d \nhe was referring to not just the investigations but also press coverage about Russia. Christie thought the \nmore important thing was that there was an investigation.  Christie 2/13/19 302, at 4. \n219 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 3. \n220 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 3. \n221 Christie 2/13/19 302, at 3. \n38 \n",

P. 6(e)\nShortly after meeting with the President, Comey began drafting a memorandum \ndocumenting their conversation.241 Comey also met with his senior leadership team to discuss the \nPresident\u2019s request, and they agreed not to inform FBI officials working on the Flynn case of the \nPresident\u2019s statements so the officials would not be influenced by the request.242  Comey also asked \nfor a meeting with Sessions and requested that Sessions not leave Comey alone with the President \nagain.243 \n8. The Media Raises Questions About the President\u2019s Delay in Terminating Flynn \nAfter Flynn was forced to resign, the press raised questions about why the President waited \nmore than two weeks after the DOJ notification to remove Flynn and whether the President had \nknown about Flynn\u2019s contacts with Kislyak before the DOJ notification.244  The press  also  \ncontinued to raise questions about connections between Russia and the President\u2019s campaign.245 \nOn February 15, 2017, the President told reporters, \u201cGeneral Flynn is a wonderful man. I think \nhe\u2019s been treated very, very unfairly by the media.\u201d246 On February 16, 2017, the President held \n241 Comey 11/15/17 302, at 11; Hearing on Russian Election Interference Before the Senate Select \nIntelligence Committee, 115th Cong.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nhistoric proportion!\u201d266  In late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a \nmessage to Flynn telling him the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong.267 \nAnalysis \nIn analyzing the President\u2019s conduct related to the Flynn investigation, the following \nevidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: \na. \nObstructive act. According to Comey\u2019s account of his February 14, 2017 meeting \nin the Oval Office, the President told him, \u201cI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to \nletting Flynn go. . . . I hope you can let this go.\u201d  In analyzing whether these statements constitute \nan obstructive act, a threshold question is whether Comey\u2019s account of the interaction is accurate, \nand, if so, whether the President\u2019s statements had the tendency to impede the administration of \njustice by shutting down an inquiry that could result in a grand jury investigation and a criminal \ncharge. \nAfter Comey\u2019s account of the President\u2019s request to \u201clet[] Flynn go\u201d became public, the \nPresident publicly disputed several aspects of the story.  The President told the New York Times \nthat he did not \u201cshoo other people out of the room\u201d when he talked to Comey and that he did not \nremember having a one-on-one conversation with Comey.268 The President also publicly denied \nthat he had asked Comey to \u201clet[] Flynn go\u201d or otherwise communicated that Comey should drop \nthe investigation of Flynn.269 In private, the President denied aspects of Comey\u2019s account to White \nHouse advisors, but acknowledged to Priebus that he brought Flynn up in the meeting with Comey \nand stated that Flynn was a good guy.270  Despite those denials, substantial evidence corroborates \nComey\u2019s account. \n266 @realDonaldTrump 3/31/17 (7:04 a.m. ET) Tweet; see Shane Harris at al., Mike Flynn Offers \nto Testify in Exchange for Immunity, Wall Street Journal (Mar. 30, 2017). \n267 McFarland 12/22/17 302, at 18. \n268 Excerpts From The Times\u2019s Interview With Trump, New York Times (July 19, 2017). Hicks \nrecalled that the President told her he had never asked Comey to stay behind in his office. Hicks 12/8/17 \n302, at 12. \n269 In a statement on May 16, 2017, the White House said: \u201cWhile the President has repeatedly \nexpressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President \nhas never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving \nGeneral Flynn. . . . This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the President \nand Mr. Comey.\u201d See Michael S. Schmidt, Comey Memorandum Says Trump Asked Him to End Flynn \nInvestigation, New York Times (May 16, 2017) (quoting White House statement); @realDonaldTrump \n12/3/17 (6:15 a.m. ET) Tweet (\u201cI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News \ncovering another Comey lie!\u201d). \n270 Priebus recalled that the President acknowledged telling Comey that Flynn was a good guy and \nhe hoped \u201ceverything worked out for him.\u201d Priebus 10/13/17 302, at 19. McGahn recalled that the \nPresident denied saying to Comey that he hoped Comey would let Flynn go, but added that he was \u201callowed \nto hope.\u201d The President told McGahn he did not think he had crossed any lines.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nFirst, Comey wrote a detailed memorandum of his encounter with the President on the \nsame day it occurred. Comey also told senior FBI officials about the meeting with the President \nthat day, and their recollections of what Comey told them at the time are consistent with Comey\u2019s \naccount.271 \nSecond, Comey provided testimony about the President\u2019s request that he \u201clet[] Flynn go\u201d \nunder oath in congressional proceedings and in interviews with federal investigators subject to \npenalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Comey\u2019s recollections of the encounter have remained \nconsistent over time. \nThird, the objective, corroborated circumstances of how the one-on-one meeting came to \noccur support Comey\u2019s description of the event. Comey recalled that the President cleared the \nroom to speak with Comey alone after a homeland security briefing in the Oval Office, that  \nKushner and Sessions lingered and had to be shooed out by the President, and that Priebus briefly \nopened the door during the meeting, prompting the President to wave him away.  While the  \nPresident has publicly denied those details, other Administration officials who were present have \nconfirmed Comey\u2019s account of how he ended up in a one-on-one meeting with the President.272 \nAnd the President acknowledged to Priebus and McGahn that he in fact spoke to Comey about \nFlynn in their one-on-one meeting. \nFourth, the President\u2019s decision to clear the room and, in particular, to exclude the Attorney \nGeneral from the meeting signals that the President wanted to be alone with Comey, which is \nconsistent with the delivery of a message of the type that Comey recalls, rather than a more \ninnocuous conversation that could have occurred in the presence of the Attorney General.   \nFinally, Comey\u2019s reaction to the President\u2019s statements is consistent with the President \nhaving asked him to \u201clet[] Flynn go.\u201d Comey met with the FBI leadership team, which agreed to \nkeep the President\u2019s statements closely held and not to inform the team working on the Flynn \ninvestigation so that they would not be influenced by the President\u2019s request. Comey also promptly \nmet with the Attorney General to ask him not to be left alone with the President again, an account \nverified by Sessions, FBI Chief of Staff James Rybicki, and Jody Hunt, who was then the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s chief of staff. \nA second question is whether the President\u2019s statements, which were not phrased as a direct \norder to Comey, could impede or interfere with the FBI\u2019s investigation of Flynn. While the \nPresident said he \u201chope[d]\u201d Comey could \u201clet[] Flynn go,\u201d rather than affirmatively directing him \nto do so, the circumstances of the conversation show that the President was asking Comey to close \nthe FBI\u2019s investigation into Flynn. First, the President arranged the meeting with Comey so that \nthey would be alone and purposely excluded the Attorney General, which suggests that the \nPresident meant to make a request to Comey that he did not want anyone else to hear.  Second, \nbecause the President is the head of the Executive Branch, when he says that he \u201chopes\u201d a \nsubordinate will do something, it is reasonable to expect that the subordinate will do what the \nPresident wants.  Indeed, the President repeated a version of \u201clet this go\u201d three times, and Comey \n271 Rybicki 11/21/18 302, at 4; McCabe 8/17/17 302, at 13-14.  \n272 See Priebus 10/13/17 302, at 18; Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 6.   \n45 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ntestified that he understood the President\u2019s statements as a directive, which is corroborated by the \nway Comey reacted at the time.   \nb. \nNexus to a proceeding. To establish a nexus to a proceeding, it would be necessary \nto show that the President could reasonably foresee and actually contemplated that the \ninvestigation of Flynn was likely to lead to a grand jury investigation or prosecution.   \nAt the time of the President\u2019s one-on-one meeting with Comey, no grand jury subpoenas \nhad been issued as part of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Flynn.  But Flynn\u2019s lies to the FBI violated \nfederal criminal law, Grand Jury\n, and resulted in Flynn\u2019s \nprosecution for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. By the time the President spoke to Comey about \nFlynn, DOJ officials had informed McGahn, who informed the President, that Flynn\u2019s statements \nto senior White House officials about his contacts with Kislyak were not true and that Flynn had \ntold the same version of events to the FBI. McGahn also informed the President that Flynn\u2019s \nconduct could violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. After the Vice President and senior White House officials \nreviewed the underlying information about Flynn\u2019s calls on February 10, 2017, they believed that \nFlynn could not have forgotten his conversations with Kislyak and concluded that he had been \nlying. In addition, the President\u2019s instruction to the FBI Director to \u201clet[] Flynn go\u201d suggests his \nawareness that Flynn could face criminal exposure for his conduct and was at risk of prosecution. \nc. \nIntent. As part of our investigation, we examined whether the President had a \npersonal stake in the outcome of an investigation into Flynn\u2014for example, whether the President \nwas aware of Flynn\u2019s communications with Kislyak close in time to when they occurred, such that \nthe President knew that Flynn had lied to senior White House officials and that those lies had been \npassed on to the public.  Some evidence suggests that the President knew about the existence and \ncontent of Flynn\u2019s calls when they occurred, but the evidence is inconclusive and could not be \nrelied upon to establish the President\u2019s knowledge. In advance of Flynn\u2019s initial call with Kislyak, \nthe President attended a meeting where the sanctions were discussed and an advisor may have \nmentioned that Flynn was scheduled to talk to Kislyak. Flynn told McFarland about the substance \nof his calls with Kislyak and said they may have made a difference in Russia\u2019s response, and Flynn \nrecalled talking to Bannon in early January 2017 about how they had successfully \u201cstopped the \ntrain on Russia\u2019s response\u201d to the sanctions. It would have been reasonable for Flynn to have \nwanted the President to know of his communications with Kislyak because Kislyak told Flynn his \nrequest had been received at the highest levels in Russia and that Russia had chosen not to retaliate \nin response to the request, and the President was pleased by the Russian response, calling it a \n\u201c[g]reat move.\u201d And the President never said publicly or internally that Flynn had lied to him \nabout the calls with Kislyak.   \nBut McFarland did not recall providing the President-Elect with Flynn\u2019s read-out of his \ncalls with Kislyak, and Flynn does not have a specific recollection of telling the President-Elect \ndirectly about the calls. Bannon also said he did not recall hearing about the calls from Flynn. \nAnd in February 2017, the President asked Flynn what was discussed on the calls and whether he \nhad lied to the Vice President, suggesting that he did not already know. Our investigation \naccordingly did not produce evidence that established that the President knew about Flynn\u2019s \ndiscussions of sanctions before the Department of Justice notified the White House of those \ndiscussions in late January 2017. The evidence also does not establish that Flynn otherwise \n46 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\npossessed information damaging to the President that would give the President a personal incentive \nto end the FBI\u2019s inquiry into Flynn\u2019s conduct. \nEvidence does establish that the President connected the Flynn investigation to the FBI\u2019s \nbroader Russia investigation and that he believed, as he told Christie, that terminating Flynn would \nend \u201cthe whole Russia thing.\u201d Flynn\u2019s firing occurred at a time when the media and Congress \nwere raising questions about Russia\u2019s interference in the election and whether members of the \nPresident\u2019s campaign had colluded with Russia. Multiple witnesses recalled that the President \nviewed the Russia investigations as a challenge to the legitimacy of his election. The President \npaid careful attention to negative coverage of Flynn and reacted with annoyance and anger when \nthe story broke disclosing that Flynn had discussed sanctions with Kislyak. Just hours before \nmeeting one-on-one with Comey, the President told Christie that firing Flynn would put an end to \nthe Russia inquiries. And after Christie pushed back, telling the President that firing Flynn would \nnot end the Russia investigation, the President asked Christie to reach out to Comey and convey \nthat the President liked him and he was part of \u201cthe team.\u201d  That afternoon, the President cleared \nthe room and asked Comey to \u201clet[] Flynn go.\u201d \nWe also sought evidence relevant to assessing whether the President\u2019s direction to Comey \nwas motivated by sympathy towards Flynn. In public statements the President repeatedly \ndescribed Flynn as a good person who had been harmed by the Russia investigation, and the \nPresident directed advisors to reach out to Flynn to tell him the President \u201ccare[d]\u201d \nabout him and felt bad for him. At the same time, multiple senior advisors, including Bannon, \nPriebus, and Hicks, said that the President had become unhappy with Flynn well before Flynn was \nforced to resign and that the President was frequently irritated with Flynn. Priebus said he believed \nthe President\u2019s initial reluctance to fire Flynn stemmed not from personal regard, but from concern \nabout the negative press that would be generated by firing the National Security Advisor so early \nin the Administration. And Priebus indicated that the President\u2019s post-firing expressions of \nsupport for Flynn were motivated by the President\u2019s desire to keep Flynn from saying negative \nthings about him.   \nThe way in which the President communicated the request to Comey also is relevant to \nunderstanding the President\u2019s intent. When the President first learned about the FBI investigation \ninto Flynn, he told McGahn, Bannon, and Priebus not to discuss the matter with anyone else in the \nWhite House. The next day, the President invited Comey for a one-on-one dinner against the \nadvice of an aide who recommended that other White House officials also attend. At the dinner, \nthe President asked Comey for \u201cloyalty\u201d and, at a different point in the conversation, mentioned \nthat Flynn had judgment issues. When the President met with Comey the day after Flynn\u2019s \ntermination\u2014shortly after being told by Christie that firing Flynn would not end the Russia \ninvestigation\u2014the President cleared the room, even excluding the Attorney General, so that he \ncould again speak to Comey alone. The President\u2019s decision to meet one-on-one with Comey \ncontravened the advice of the White House Counsel that the President should not communicate \ndirectly with the Department of Justice to avoid any appearance of interfering in law enforcement \nactivities. And the President later denied that he cleared the room and asked Comey to \u201clet[] Flynn \ngo\u201d\u2014a denial that would have been unnecessary if he believed his request was a proper exercise \nof prosecutorial discretion. \n47 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nFinally, the President\u2019s effort to have McFarland write an internal email denying that the \nPresident had directed Flynn to discuss sanctions with Kislyak highlights the President\u2019s concern \nabout being associated with Flynn\u2019s conduct. The evidence does not establish that the President \nwas trying to have McFarland lie. The President\u2019s request, however, was sufficiently irregular \nthat McFarland\u2014who did not know the full extent of Flynn\u2019s communications with the President \nand thus could not make the representation the President wanted\u2014felt the need to draft an internal \nmemorandum documenting the President\u2019s request, and Eisenberg was concerned that the request \nwould look like a quid pro quo in exchange for an ambassadorship. \nC.  \nThe President\u2019s Reaction to Public Confirmation of the FBI\u2019s  Russia \nInvestigation  \nOverview \nIn early March 2017, the President learned that Sessions was considering recusing from \nthe Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal. After Sessions announced his recusal on \nMarch 2, the President expressed anger at Sessions for the decision and then privately asked \nSessions to \u201cunrecuse.\u201d On March 20, 2017, Comey publicly disclosed the existence of the FBI\u2019s \nRussia investigation. In the days that followed, the President contacted Comey and other \nintelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly on the suggestion that the \nPresident had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in order to \u201clift the cloud\u201d \nof the ongoing investigation. \nEvidence \n1. Attorney General Sessions Recuses From the Russia Investigation \nIn late February 2017, the Department of Justice began an internal analysis of whether \nSessions should recuse from the Russia investigation based on his role in the 2016 Trump \nCampaign.273 On March 1, 2017, the press reported that, in his January confirmation hearing to \nbecome Attorney General, Senator Sessions had not disclosed two meetings he had with Russian \nAmbassador Kislyak before the presidential election, leading to congressional calls for Sessions \nto recuse or for a special counsel to investigate Russia\u2019s interference in the presidential election.274 \nAlso on March 1, the President called Comey and said he wanted to check in and see how \nComey was doing.275 According to an email Comey sent to his chief of staff after the call, the \nPresident \u201ctalked about Sessions a bit,\u201d said that he had heard Comey was \u201cdoing great,\u201d and said \nthat he hoped Comey would come by to say hello when he was at the White House.276  Comey \n273 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 1; Hunt 2/1/18 302, at 3. \n274 E.g., Adam Entous et al., Sessions met with Russian envoy twice last year, encounters he later \ndid not disclose, Washington Post (Mar. 1, 2017). \n275 3/1/17 Email, Comey to Rybicki; SCR012b_000030 (President\u2019s Daily Diary, 3/1/17, reflecting \ncall with Comey at 11:55 am.) \n276 3/1/17 Email, Comey to Rybicki; see Hearing on Russian Election Interference Before the \nSenate Select Intelligence Committee, 115th Cong.

P. 6(e)\nPress reports following Comey\u2019s March 20 testimony suggested that the FBI was \ninvestigating the President, contrary to what Comey had told the President at the end of the January \n6, 2017 intelligence assessment briefing.321 McGahn, Donaldson, and senior advisor Stephen \nMiller recalled that the President was upset with Comey\u2019s testimony and the press coverage that \nfollowed because of the suggestion that the President was under investigation.322  Notes from the \nWhite House Counsel\u2019s Office dated March 21, 2017, indicate that the President was \u201cbeside \nhimself\u201d over Comey\u2019s testimony.323 The President called McGahn repeatedly that day to ask him \nto intervene with the Department of Justice, and, according to the notes, the President was \u201cgetting \nhotter and hotter, get rid?\u201d324 Officials in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office became so concerned \nthat the President would fire Comey that they began drafting a memorandum that examined \nwhether the President needed cause to terminate the FBI director.325 \nAt the President\u2019s urging, McGahn contacted Boente several times on March 21, 2017, to \nseek Boente\u2019s assistance in having Comey or the Department of Justice correct the misperception \nthat the President was under investigation.326 Boente did not specifically recall the conversations, \nalthough he did remember one conversation with McGahn around this time where McGahn asked \nif there was a way to speed up or end the Russia investigation as quickly as possible.327 Boente \nsaid McGahn told him the President was under a cloud and it made it hard for him to govern.328 \nBoente recalled telling McGahn that there was no good way to shorten the investigation and \nattempting to do so could erode confidence in the investigation\u2019s conclusions.329 Boente said \nMcGahn agreed and dropped the issue.330 The President also sought to speak with Boente directly, \nbut McGahn told the President that Boente did not want to talk to the President about the request \n321 E.g., Matt Apuzzo et al., F.B.I.

The President Asks Intelligence Community Leaders to Make Public \nStatements that he had No Connection to Russia \nIn the weeks following Comey\u2019s March 20, 2017 testimony, the President repeatedly asked \nintelligence community officials to push back publicly on any suggestion that the President had a \nconnection to the Russian election-interference effort. \nOn March 22, 2017, the President asked Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and \nCIA Director Michael Pompeo to stay behind in the Oval Office after a Presidential Daily \nBriefing.334 According to Coats, the President asked them whether they could say publicly that no \nlink existed between him and Russia.335 Coats responded that the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (ODNI) has nothing to do with investigations and it was not his role to make a public \nstatement on the Russia investigation.336 Pompeo had no recollection of being asked to stay behind \nafter the March 22 briefing, but he recalled that the President regularly urged officials to get the \nword out that he had not done anything wrong related to Russia.337 \nCoats told this Office that the President never asked him to speak to Comey about the FBI \ninvestigation.338 \nSome ODNI staffers, however, had a different recollection of how Coats \ndescribed the meeting immediately after it occurred. According to senior ODNI official Michael \nDempsey, Coats said after the meeting that the President had brought up the Russia investigation \nand asked him to contact Comey to see if there was a way to get past the investigation, get it over \nwith, end it, or words to that effect.339  Dempsey said that Coats described the President\u2019s  \ncomments as falling \u201csomewhere between musing about hating the investigation\u201d and wanting \nCoats to \u201cdo something to stop it.\u201d340 Dempsey said Coats made it clear that he would not get \ninvolved with an ongoing FBI investigation.341 Edward Gistaro, another ODNI official, recalled \n331 SC_AD_00210 (Donaldson 3/21/17 Notes); McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 7; Donaldson 11/6/17 \n302, at 19.  \n332 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 7; Burnham 11/03/17 302, at 11. \n333 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 3. \n334 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3; Culver 6/14/17 302, at 2. \n335 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3. \n336 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3. \n337 Pompeo 6/28/17 302, at 1-3. \n338 Coats 6/14/17 302, at 3. \n339 Dempsey 6/14/17 302, at 2. \n340 Dempsey 6/14/17 302, at 2-3. \n341 Dempsey 6/14/17 302, at 3. \n55 \n",

P. 6(e)\nappointment of a Special Counsel.380 Boente did not recall that aspect of his conversation with \nMcGahn, but did recall telling McGahn that the direct outreaches from the President to Comey \nwere a problem.381 Boente recalled that McGahn agreed and said he would do what he could to \naddress that issue.382 \nAnalysis \nIn analyzing the President\u2019s reaction to Sessions\u2019s recusal and the requests he made to \nCoats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of \nobstruction of justice: \na. \nObstructive act. \nThe evidence shows that, after Comey\u2019s March 20, 2017 \ntestimony, the President repeatedly reached out to intelligence agency leaders to discuss the FBI\u2019s \ninvestigation. But witnesses had different recollections of the precise content of those outreaches.  \nSome ODNI officials recalled that Coats told them immediately after the March 22 Oval Office \nmeeting that the President asked Coats to intervene with Comey and \u201cstop\u201d the investigation. But \nthe first-hand witnesses to the encounter remember the conversation differently. Pompeo had no \nmemory of the specific meeting, but generally recalled the President urging officials to get the \nword out that the President had not done anything wrong related to Russia.  Coats recalled that the \nPresident asked that Coats state publicly that no link existed between the President and Russia, but \ndid not ask him to speak with Comey or to help end the investigation. The other outreaches by the \nPresident during this period were similar in nature. The President asked Rogers if he could do \nanything to refute the stories linking the President to Russia, and the President asked Comey to \nmake a public statement that would \u201clift the cloud\u201d of the ongoing investigation by making clear \nthat the President was not personally under investigation. These requests, while significant enough \nthat Rogers thought it important to document the encounter in a written memorandum, were not \ninterpreted by the officials who received them as directives to improperly interfere with the \ninvestigation. \nb. \nNexus to a proceeding. At the time of the President\u2019s outreaches to leaders of the \nintelligence agencies in late March and early April 2017, the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation did not \nyet involve grand jury proceedings. The outreaches, however, came after and were in response to \nComey\u2019s March 20, 2017 announcement that the FBI, as a part of its counterintelligence mission, \nwas conducting an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \nComey testified that the investigation included any links or coordination with Trump campaign \nofficials and would \u201cinclude an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.\u201d    \nc. \nIntent. As described above, the evidence does not establish that the President asked \nor directed intelligence agency leaders to stop or interfere with the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation\u2014 \nand the President affirmatively told Comey that if \u201csome satellite\u201d was involved in Russian \nelection interference \u201cit would be good to find that out.\u201d But the President\u2019s intent in trying to \nprevent Sessions\u2019s recusal, and in reaching out to Coats, Pompeo, Rogers, and Comey following \n380 McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 9-10. \n381 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 7; McGahn 12/12/17 302, at 9. \n382 Boente 1/31/18 302, at 7. \n60 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nComey\u2019s public announcement of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, is nevertheless relevant to \nunderstanding what motivated the President\u2019s other actions towards the investigation. \nThe evidence shows that the President was focused on the Russia investigation\u2019s \nimplications for his presidency\u2014and, specifically, on dispelling any suggestion that he was under \ninvestigation or had links to Russia. In early March, the President attempted to prevent Sessions\u2019s \nrecusal, even after being told that Sessions was following DOJ conflict-of-interest rules. After \nSessions recused, the White House Counsel\u2019s Office tried to cut off further contact with Sessions \nabout the matter, although it is not clear whether that direction was conveyed to the President. The \nPresident continued to raise the issue of Sessions\u2019s recusal and, when he had the opportunity, he \npulled Sessions aside and urged him to unrecuse.  The President also told advisors that he wanted \nan Attorney General who would protect him, the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric \nHolder to have protected their presidents. The President made statements about being able to direct \nthe course of criminal investigations, saying words to the effect of, \u201cYou\u2019re telling me that Bobby \nand Jack didn\u2019t talk about investigations?  Or Obama didn\u2019t tell Eric Holder who to investigate?\u201d    \nAfter Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation on March \n20, 2017, the President was \u201cbeside himself\u201d and expressed anger that Comey did not issue a \nstatement correcting any misperception that the President himself was under investigation. The \nPresident sought to speak with Acting Attorney General Boente directly and told McGahn to \ncontact Boente to request that Comey make a clarifying statement. The President then asked other \nintelligence community leaders to make public statements to refute the suggestion that the \nPresident had links to Russia, but the leaders told him they could not publicly comment on the \ninvestigation. On March 30 and April 11, against the advice of White House advisors who had \ninformed him that any direct contact with the FBI could be perceived as improper interference in \nan ongoing investigation, the President made personal outreaches to Comey asking him to \u201clift the \ncloud\u201d of the Russia investigation by making public the fact that the President was not personally \nunder investigation. \nEvidence indicates that the President was angered by both the existence of the Russia \ninvestigation and the public reporting that he was under investigation, which he knew was not true \nbased on Comey\u2019s representations. The President complained to advisors that if people thought \nRussia helped him with the election, it would detract from what he had accomplished. \nOther evidence indicates that the President was concerned about the impact of the Russia \ninvestigation on his ability to govern. The President complained that the perception that he was \nunder investigation was hurting his ability to conduct foreign relations, particularly with Russia.  \nThe President told Coats he \u201ccan\u2019t do anything with Russia,\u201d he told Rogers that \u201cthe thing with \nthe Russians\u201d was interfering with his ability to conduct foreign affairs, and he told Comey that \n\u201che was trying to run the country and the cloud of this Russia business was making that difficult.\u201d \n61 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nD. \nEvents Leading Up To and Surrounding the Termination of FBI Director \nComey \nOverview \nComey was scheduled to testify before Congress on May 3, 2017. Leading up to that \ntestimony, the President continued to tell advisors that he wanted Comey to make public that the \nPresident was not under investigation.  At the hearing, Comey declined to answer questions about \nthe scope or subjects of the Russia investigation and did not state publicly that the President was \nnot under investigation. Two days later, on May 5, 2017, the President told close aides he was \ngoing to fire Comey, and on May 9, he did so, using his official termination letter to make public \nthat Comey had on three occasions informed the President that he was not under investigation.  \nThe President decided to fire Comey before receiving advice or a recommendation from the \nDepartment of Justice, but he approved an initial public account of the termination that attributed \nit to a recommendation from the Department of Justice based on Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton \nemail investigation. After Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein resisted attributing the firing \nto his recommendation, the President acknowledged that he intended to fire Comey regardless of \nthe DOJ recommendation and was thinking of the Russia investigation when he made the decision.  \nThe President also told the Russian Foreign Minister, \u201cI just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was \ncrazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia.  That\u2019s taken off. . . . .  I\u2019m not \nunder investigation.\u201d \nEvidence \n1. Comey Testifies Before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Declines to \nAnswer Questions About Whether the President is Under Investigation  \nOn May 3, 2017, Comey was scheduled to testify at an FBI oversight hearing before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.383 McGahn recalled that in the week leading up to the hearing, the \nPresident said that it would be the last straw if Comey did not take the opportunity to set the record \nstraight by publicly announcing that the President was not under investigation.384 The President \nhad previously told McGahn that the perception that the President was under investigation was \nhurting his ability to carry out his presidential duties and deal with foreign leaders.385 At the \nhearing, Comey declined to answer questions about the status of the Russia investigation, stating \n\u201c[t]he Department of Justice ha[d] authorized [him] to confirm that [the Russia investigation] \nexists,\u201d but that he was \u201cnot going to say another word about it\u201d until the investigation was \ncompleted.386 Comey also declined to answer questions about whether investigators had \u201cruled \n383 Hearing on Oversight of the FBI before the Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong.

It\u2019s all because you recused. AG is supposed to be most important \nappointment. Kennedy appointed his brother. Obama appointed Holder. I appointed you and you \nrecused yourself.

See id. at 26 (explaining that he was \u201cnot going to say another peep \nabout [the investigation] until we\u2019re done\u201d); id. at 90 (stating that he would not provide any updates about \nthe status of investigation \u201cbefore the matter is concluded\u201d). \n387 Hearing on FBI Oversight Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong.

P. 6(e)\nthe President.445 Dhillon made a final pitch to the President that Comey should be permitted to \nresign, but the President refused.446 \nAround the time the President\u2019s letter was finalized, Priebus summoned Spicer and the \npress team to the Oval Office, where they were told that Comey had been terminated for the reasons \nstated in the letters by Rosenstein and Sessions.447 To announce Comey\u2019s termination, the White \nHouse released a statement, which Priebus thought had been dictated by the President.448  In full, \nthe statement read: \u201cToday, President Donald J. Trump informed FBI Director James Comey that \nhe has been terminated and removed from office. President Trump acted based on the clear \nrecommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff \nSessions.\u201d449 \nThat evening, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was summoned to meet with the \nPresident at the White House.450 The President told McCabe that he had fired Comey because of \nthe decisions Comey had made in the Clinton email investigation and for many other reasons.451 \nThe President asked McCabe if he was aware that Comey had told the President three times that \nhe was not under investigation.452 The President also asked McCabe whether many people in the \nFBI disliked Comey and whether McCabe was part of the \u201cresistance\u201d that had disagreed with \nComey\u2019s decisions in the Clinton investigation.453  McCabe told the President that he knew Comey \nhad told the President he was not under investigation, that most people in the FBI felt positively \nabout Comey, and that McCabe worked \u201cvery closely\u201d with Comey and was part of all the \ndecisions that had been made in the Clinton investigation.454 \n445 Dhillon 11/21/17 302, at 10; Eisenberg 11/29/17 302, at 15 (providing the view that the \nPresident\u2019s desire to include the language about not being under investigation was the \u201cdriving animus of \nthe whole thing\u201d); Burnham 11/3/17 302, at 16 (Burnham knew the only line the President cared about was \nthe line that said Comey advised the President on three separate occasions that the President was not under \ninvestigation). According to Hunt\u2019s notes, the reference to Comey\u2019s statement would indicate that \n\u201cnotwithstanding\u201d Comey\u2019s having informed the President that he was not under investigation, the \nPresident was terminating Comey. Hunt-000032 (Hunt 5/9/17 Notes).

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nPresident\u2019s decision to terminate Comey was driven by the recommendations the President \nreceived from Rosenstein and Sessions.467 \nIn the morning on May 10, 2017, President Trump met with Russian Foreign Minister \nSergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office.468  The media  \nsubsequently reported that during the May 10 meeting the President brought up his decision the \nprior day to terminate Comey, telling Lavrov and Kislyak: \u201cI just fired the head of the F.B.I.  He \nwas crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia.  That\u2019s taken off. . . .  I\u2019m not \nunder investigation.\u201d469 The President never denied making those statements, and the White House \ndid not dispute the account, instead issuing a statement that said: \u201cBy grandstanding and \npoliticizing the investigation into Russia\u2019s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on \nour ability to engage and negotiate with Russia.  The investigation would have always continued, \nand obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is \nthat our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified \ninformation.\u201d470 Hicks said that when she told the President about the reports on his meeting with \nLavrov, he did not look concerned and said of Comey, \u201che is crazy.\u201d471  When McGahn asked the \nPresident about his comments to Lavrov, the President said it was good that Comey was fired \nbecause that took the pressure off by making it clear that he was not under investigation so he \ncould get more work done.472 \nThat same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe.473 According to a \nmemorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the \nWhite House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to \n467 See, e.g., Sarah Sanders, White House Daily Briefing, C-SPAN (May 10, 2017); \nSCR013_001088 (5/10/17 Email, Hemming to Cheung et al.)

The meeting had been \nplanned on May 2, 2017, during a telephone call between the President and Russian President Vladimir \nPutin, and the meeting date was confirmed on May 5, 2017, the same day the President dictated ideas for \nthe Comey termination letter to Stephen Miller.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nafter being sworn in.495 Late in the morning of May 12, 2017, the President tweeted, \u201cAgain, the \nstory that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems \nas an excuse for losing the election.\u201d496 The President also tweeted, \u201cJames Comey better hope \nthat there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d and \u201cWhen \nJames Clapper himself, and virtually everyone else with knowledge of the witch hunt, says there \nis no collusion, when does it end?\u201d497 \nAnalysis \nIn analyzing the President\u2019s decision to fire Comey, the following evidence is relevant to \nthe elements of obstruction of justice: \na. \nObstructive act. The act of firing Comey removed the individual overseeing the \nFBI\u2019s Russia investigation. The President knew that Comey was personally involved in the \ninvestigation based on Comey\u2019s briefing of the Gang of Eight, Comey\u2019s March 20, 2017 public \ntestimony about the investigation, and the President\u2019s one-on-one conversations with Comey.   \nFiring Comey would qualify as an obstructive act if it had the natural and probable effect \nof interfering with or impeding the investigation\u2014for example, if the termination would have the \neffect of delaying or disrupting the investigation or providing the President with the opportunity \nto appoint a director who would take a different approach to the investigation that the President \nperceived as more protective of his personal interests. Relevant circumstances bearing on that \nissue include whether the President\u2019s actions had the potential to discourage a successor director \nor other law enforcement officials in their conduct of the Russia investigation. The President fired \nComey abruptly without offering him an opportunity to resign, banned him from the FBI building, \nand criticized him publicly, calling him a \u201cshowboat\u201d and claiming that the FBI was \u201cin turmoil\u201d \nunder his leadership. And the President followed the termination with public statements that were \nhighly critical of the investigation; for example, three days after firing Comey, the President \nreferred to the investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and asked, \u201cwhen does it end?\u201d Those actions had \nthe potential to affect a successor director\u2019s conduct of the investigation. \nThe anticipated effect of removing the FBI director, however, would not necessarily be to \nprevent or impede the FBI from continuing its investigation. \nAs a general matter, FBI \ninvestigations run under the operational direction of FBI personnel levels below the FBI director. \nBannon made a similar point when he told the President that he could fire the FBI director, but \ncould not fire the FBI. The White House issued a press statement the day after Comey was fired \nthat said, \u201cThe investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of \nComey would not have ended it.\u201d In addition, in his May 11 interview with Lester Holt, the \nPresident stated that he understood when he made the decision to fire Comey that the action might \nprolong the investigation. And the President chose McCabe to serve as interim director, even \n495 Michael S. Schmidt, In a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty.

P. 6(e)\nthough McCabe told the President he had worked \u201cvery closely\u201d with Comey and was part of all \nthe decisions made in the Clinton investigation. \nb. \nNexus to a proceeding. The nexus element would be satisfied by evidence showing \nthat a grand jury proceeding or criminal prosecution arising from an FBI investigation was \nobjectively foreseeable and actually contemplated by the President when he terminated Comey. \nSeveral facts would be relevant to such a showing. At the time the President fired Comey, \na grand jury had not begun to hear evidence related to the Russia investigation and no grand jury \nsubpoenas had been issued. On March 20, 2017, however, Comey had announced that the FBI \nwas investigating Russia\u2019s interference in the election, including \u201can assessment of whether any \ncrimes were committed.\u201d It was widely known that the FBI, as part of the Russia investigation, \nwas investigating the hacking of the DNC\u2019s computers\u2014a clear criminal offense.   \nIn addition, at the time the President fired Comey, evidence indicates the President knew \nthat Flynn was still under criminal investigation and could potentially be prosecuted, despite the \nPresident\u2019s February 14, 2017 request that Comey \u201clet[] Flynn go.\u201d On March 5, 2017, the White \nHouse Counsel\u2019s Office was informed that the FBI was asking for transition-period records \nrelating to Flynn\u2014indicating that the FBI was still actively investigating him.  The same day, the \nPresident told advisors he wanted to call Dana Boente, then the Acting Attorney General for the \nRussia investigation, to find out whether the White House or the President was being investigated. \nOn March 31, 2017, the President signaled his awareness that Flynn remained in legal jeopardy by \ntweeting that \u201cMike Flynn should ask for immunity\u201d before he agreed to provide testimony to the \nFBI or Congress. And in late March or early April, the President asked McFarland to pass a \nmessage to Flynn telling him that the President felt bad for him and that he should stay strong, \nfurther demonstrating the President\u2019s awareness of Flynn\u2019s criminal exposure.  \nc. \nIntent. Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President\u2019s decision \nto fire Comey was Comey\u2019s unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally \nunder investigation, despite the President\u2019s repeated requests that Comey make such an \nannouncement. In the week leading up to Comey\u2019s May 3, 2017 Senate Judiciary Committee \ntestimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Comey did not set the record \nstraight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation. But during his May \n3 testimony, Comey refused to answer questions about whether the President was being \ninvestigated. Comey\u2019s refusal angered the President, who criticized Sessions for leaving him \nisolated and exposed, saying \u201cYou left me on an island.\u201d Two days later, the President told \nadvisors he had decided to fire Comey and dictated a letter to Stephen Miller that began with a \nreference to the fact that the President was not being investigated: \u201cWhile I greatly appreciate you \ninforming me that I am not under investigation concerning what I have often stated is a fabricated \nstory on a Trump-Russia relationship . . . .\u201d \nThe President later asked Rosenstein to include \n\u201cRussia\u201d in his memorandum and to say that Comey had told the President that he was not under \ninvestigation. And the President\u2019s final termination letter included a sentence, at the President\u2019s \ninsistence and against McGahn\u2019s advice, stating that Comey had told the President on three \nseparate occasions that he was not under investigation. \nThe President\u2019s other stated rationales for why he fired Comey are not similarly supported \nby the evidence. The termination letter the President and Stephen Miller prepared in Bedminster \n75 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ncited Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton email investigation, and the President told McCabe he fired \nComey for that reason. But the facts surrounding Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton email \ninvestigation were well known to the President at the time he assumed office, and the President \nhad made it clear to both Comey and the President\u2019s senior staff in early 2017 that he wanted \nComey to stay on as director. And Rosenstein articulated his criticism of Comey\u2019s handling of the \nClinton investigation after the President had already decided to fire Comey. The President\u2019s draft \ntermination letter also stated that morale in the FBI was at an all-time low and Sanders told the \npress after Comey\u2019s termination that the White House had heard from \u201ccountless\u201d FBI agents who \nhad lost confidence in Comey. But the evidence does not support those claims. The President told \nComey at their January 27 dinner that \u201cthe people of the FBI really like [him],\u201d no evidence \nsuggests that the President heard otherwise before deciding to terminate Comey, and Sanders \nacknowledged to investigators that her comments were not founded on anything.  \nWe also considered why it was important to the President that Comey announce publicly \nthat he was not under investigation. Some evidence indicates that the President believed that the \nerroneous perception he was under investigation harmed his ability to manage domestic and \nforeign affairs, particularly in dealings with Russia. The President told Comey that the \u201ccloud\u201d of \n\u201cthis Russia business\u201d was making it difficult to run the country.  The President told Sessions and \nMcGahn that foreign leaders had expressed sympathy to him for being under investigation and that \nthe perception he was under investigation was hurting his ability to address foreign relations issues.  \nThe President complained to Rogers that \u201cthe thing with the Russians [was] messing up\u201d his ability \nto get things done with Russia, and told Coats, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything with Russia, there\u2019s things I\u2019d \nlike to do with Russia, with trade, with ISIS, they\u2019re all over me with this.\u201d  The President also \nmay have viewed Comey as insubordinate for his failure to make clear in the May 3 testimony that \nthe President was not under investigation.   \nOther evidence, however, indicates that the President wanted to protect himself from an \ninvestigation into his campaign. The day after learning about the FBI\u2019s interview of Flynn, the \nPresident had a one-on-one dinner with Comey, against the advice of senior aides, and told Comey \nhe needed Comey\u2019s \u201cloyalty.\u201d When the President later asked Comey for a second time to make \npublic that he was not under investigation, he brought up loyalty again, saying \u201cBecause I have \nbeen very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.\u201d After the President learned of \nSessions\u2019s recusal from the Russia investigation, the President was furious and said he wanted an \nAttorney General who would protect him the way he perceived Robert Kennedy and Eric Holder \nto have protected their presidents.  The President also said he wanted to be able to tell his Attorney \nGeneral \u201cwho to investigate.\u201d      \nIn addition, the President had a motive to put the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation behind him.  \nThe evidence does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a \nconspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia: As described in Volume I, the evidence \nuncovered in the investigation did not establish that the President or those close to him were \ninvolved in the charged Russian computer-hacking or active-measure conspiracies, or that the \nPresident otherwise had an unlawful relationship with any Russian official. But the evidence does \nindicate that a thorough FBI investigation would uncover facts about the campaign and the \nPresident personally that the President could have understood to be crimes or that would give rise \nto personal and political concerns. Although the President publicly stated during and after the \nelection that he had no connection to Russia, the Trump Organization, through Michael Cohen, \n76 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nwas pursuing the proposed Trump Tower Moscow project through June 2016 and candidate Trump  \nwas repeatedly briefed on the progress of those efforts.498   In  addition,  some witnesses said that \nTrump \nwas aware that\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\n at a time when public reports stated that Russian intelligence officials were behind the \nhacks, and that Trump privately sought information about future WikiLeaks releases.499  More \nbroadly, multiple witnesses described the President\u2019s preoccupation with press coverage of the \nRussia investigation and his persistent concern that it raised questions about the legitimacy of his \nelection.500 \nFinally, the President and White House aides initially advanced a pretextual reason to the \npress and the public for Comey\u2019s termination. In the immediate aftermath of the firing, the \nPresident dictated a press statement suggesting that he had acted based on the DOJ \nrecommendations, and White House press officials repeated that story. But the President had \ndecided to fire Comey before the White House solicited those recommendations.   Although the \nPresident ultimately acknowledged that he was going to fire Comey regardless of the Department \nof Justice\u2019s recommendations, he did so only after DOJ officials made clear to him that they would \nresist the White House\u2019s suggestion that they had prompted the process that led to Comey\u2019s \ntermination. The initial reliance on a pretextual justification could support an inference that the \nPresident had concerns about providing the real reason for the firing, although the evidence does \nnot resolve whether those concerns were personal, political, or both. \nE. \nThe President\u2019s Efforts to Remove the Special Counsel \nOverview \nThe Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting \nthe President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had \nfailed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President \nultimately did not accept. The President told senior advisors that the Special Counsel had conflicts \nof interest, but they responded that those claims were \u201cridiculous\u201d and posed no obstacle to the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s service. Department of Justice ethics officials similarly cleared the Special \nCounsel\u2019s service. On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally \ninvestigated for obstruction of justice and the President responded with a series of tweets  \n498 See Volume II, Section II.K.1, infra. \n499 See Volume I, Section III.D.1, supra. \n500 In addition to whether the President had a motive related to Russia-related matters that an FBI \ninvestigation could uncover, we considered whether the President\u2019s intent in firing Comey was connected \nto other conduct that could come to light as a result of the FBI\u2019s Russian-interference investigation. In \nparticular, Michael Cohen was a potential subject of investigation because of his pursuit of the Trump \nTower Moscow project and involvement in other activities. \nAnd facts uncovered in the Russia \ninvestigation, which our Office referred to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New \nYork, ultimately led to the conviction of Cohen in the Southern District of New York for campaign-finance \noffenses related to payments he said he made at the direction of the President. See Volume II, Section \nII.K.5, infra. The investigation, however, did not establish that when the President fired Comey, he was \nconsidering the possibility that the FBI\u2019s investigation would uncover these payments or that the President\u2019s \nintent in firing Comey was otherwise connected to a concern about these matters coming to light.       \n77 \n",

That weekend, the President called McGahn and \ndirected him to have the Special Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest. \nMcGahn did not carry out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday \nNight Massacre and instead prepared to resign.

Mueller, III as \nSpecial Counsel and authorized him to conduct the Russia investigation and matters that arose \nfrom the investigation.501 The President learned of the Special Counsel\u2019s appointment from \nSessions, who was with the President, Hunt, and McGahn conducting interviews for a new FBI \nDirector.502  Sessions stepped out of the Oval Office to take a call from Rosenstein, who told him \nabout the Special Counsel appointment, and Sessions then returned to inform the President of the \nnews.503 According to notes written by Hunt, when Sessions told the President that a Special \nCounsel had been appointed, the President slumped back in his chair and said, \u201cOh my God. This \nis terrible. This is the end of my Presidency. I\u2019m fucked.\u201d504 The President became angry and \nlambasted the Attorney General for his decision to recuse from the investigation, stating, \u201cHow \ncould you let this happen, Jeff?\u201d505 The President said the position of Attorney General was his \nmost important appointment and that Sessions had \u201clet [him] down,\u201d contrasting him to Eric \nHolder and Robert Kennedy.506 Sessions recalled that the President said to him, \u201cyou were \nsupposed to protect me,\u201d or words to that effect.507 The President returned to the consequences of \nthe appointment and said, \u201cEveryone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins \nyour presidency.

Phone records show that the President \ncalled McGahn in the afternoon on June 17, 2017, and they spoke for approximately 23 minutes.  \nSCR026_000196 (President\u2019s Daily Diary, 6/17/17) (reflecting call from the President to McGahn on \n6/17/17 with start time 2:23 p.m. and end time 2:46 p.m.); (Call Records of Don McGahn).  Phone records \ndo not show another call between McGahn and the President that day. Although McGahn recalled receiving \nmultiple calls from the President on the same day, in light of the phone records he thought it was possible \nthat the first call instead occurred on June 14, 2017, shortly after the press reported that the President was \nunder investigation for obstruction of justice. McGahn 2/28/19 302, at 1-3. While McGahn was not certain \nof the specific dates of the calls, McGahn was confident that he had at least two phone conversations with \nthe President in which the President directed him to call the Acting Attorney General to have the Special \nCounsel removed.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ninvestigation and any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry. Even if the removal \nof the lead prosecutor would not prevent the investigation from continuing under a new appointee, \na factfinder would need to consider whether the act had the potential to delay further action in the \ninvestigation, chill the actions of any replacement Special Counsel, or otherwise impede the \ninvestigation. \nA threshold question is whether the President in fact directed McGahn to have the Special \nCounsel removed. After news organizations reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered \nMcGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly disputed these accounts, and \nprivately told McGahn that he had simply wanted McGahn to bring conflicts of interest to the \nDepartment of Justice\u2019s attention. See Volume II, Section II.I, infra. Some of the President\u2019s \nspecific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with that explanation. \nSubstantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact \ndirected McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed. \nFirst, McGahn\u2019s clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein \nnot only that conflicts existed but also that \u201cMueller has to go.\u201d McGahn is a credible witness \nwith no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.601 McGahn \nspoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it \nunlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President\u2019s request. In response to that request, \nMcGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin \nto the Saturday Night Massacre. He called his lawyer, drove to the White House, packed up his \noffice, prepared to submit a resignation letter with his chief of staff, told Priebus that the President \nhad asked him to \u201cdo crazy shit,\u201d and informed Priebus and Bannon that he was leaving. Those \nacts would be a highly unusual reaction to a request to convey information to the Department of \nJustice. \nSecond, in the days before the calls to McGahn, the President, through his counsel, had \nalready brought the asserted conflicts to the attention of the Department of Justice. Accordingly, \nthe President had no reason to have McGahn call Rosenstein that weekend to raise conflicts issues \nthat already had been raised. \nThird, the President\u2019s sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate \naction on a weekend\u2014\u201cYou gotta do this.  You gotta call Rod.\u201d\u2014support McGahn\u2019s recollection \nthat the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.  \nHad the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted \nconflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the \nprocess in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.   \nFinally, the President had discussed \u201cknocking out Mueller\u201d and raised conflicts of interest \nin a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan \nto remove the Special Counsel. And in the days leading up to June 17, 2017, the President made \nclear to Priebus and Bannon, who then told Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating \n601 When this Office first interviewed McGahn about this topic, he was reluctant to share detailed \ninformation about what had occurred and only did so after continued questioning.

This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking \nan examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a \nway to terminate the Special Counsel.   \nb. \nNexus to an official proceeding. To satisfy the proceeding requirement, it would \nbe necessary to establish a nexus between the President\u2019s act of seeking to terminate the Special \nCounsel and a pending or foreseeable grand jury proceeding. \nSubstantial evidence indicates that by June 17, 2017, the President knew his conduct was \nunder investigation by a federal prosecutor who could present any evidence of federal crimes to a \ngrand jury. On May 23, 2017, McGahn explicitly warned the President that his \u201cbiggest exposure\u201d \nwas not his act of firing Comey but his \u201cother contacts\u201d and \u201ccalls,\u201d and his \u201cask re: Flynn.\u201d By \nearly June, it was widely reported in the media that federal prosecutors had issued grand jury \nsubpoenas in the Flynn inquiry and that the Special Counsel had taken over the Flynn \ninvestigation.602 On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office informed the White House that \ninvestigators would be interviewing intelligence agency officials who allegedly had been asked by \nthe President to push back against the Russia investigation. On June 14, 2017, news outlets began \nreporting that the President was himself being investigated for obstruction of justice. Based on \nwidespread reporting, the President knew that such an investigation could include his request for \nComey\u2019s loyalty; his request that Comey \u201clet[] Flynn go\u201d; his outreach to Coats and Rogers; and \nhis termination of Comey and statement to the Russian Foreign Minister that the termination had \nrelieved \u201cgreat pressure\u201d related to Russia. And on June 16, 2017, the day before he directed \nMcGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President publicly acknowledged that his \nconduct was under investigation by a federal prosecutor, tweeting, \u201cI am being investigated for \nfiring the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!\u201d  \nc. \nIntent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President\u2019s attempts to remove the \nSpecial Counsel were linked to the Special Counsel\u2019s oversight of investigations that involved the \nPresident\u2019s conduct\u2014and, most immediately, to reports that the President was being investigated \nfor potential obstruction of justice. \nBefore the President terminated Comey, the President considered it critically important that \nhe was not under investigation and that the public not erroneously think he was being investigated.  \nAs described in Volume II, Section II.D, supra, advisors perceived the President, while he was \ndrafting the Comey termination letter, to be concerned more than anything else about getting out \nthat he was not personally under investigation.  When the President learned of the appointment of \nthe Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, he expressed further concern about the investigation, saying \n\u201c[t]his is the end of my Presidency.\u201d The President also faulted Sessions for recusing, saying \u201cyou \nwere supposed to protect me.\u201d   \nOn June 14, 2017, when the Washington Post reported that the Special Counsel was \ninvestigating the President for obstruction of justice, the President was facing what he had wanted \n602 See, e.g., Evan Perez et al., CNN exclusive: Grand jury subpoenas issued in FBI\u2019s Russia \ninvestigation, CNN (May 9, 2017); Matt Ford, Why Mueller Is Taking Over the Michael Flynn Grand Jury, \nThe Atlantic (June 2, 2017). \n89 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nto avoid: a criminal investigation into his own conduct that was the subject of widespread media \nattention. The evidence indicates that news of the obstruction investigation prompted the President \nto call McGahn and seek to have the Special Counsel removed. By mid-June, the Department of \nJustice had already cleared the Special Counsel\u2019s service and the President\u2019s advisors had told him \nthat the claimed conflicts of interest were \u201csilly\u201d and did not provide a basis to remove the Special \nCounsel. On June 13, 2017, the Acting Attorney General testified before Congress that no good \ncause for removing the Special Counsel existed, and the President dictated a press statement to \nSanders saying he had no intention of firing the Special Counsel.  But the next day, the media \nreported that the President was under investigation for obstruction of justice and the Special \nCounsel was interviewing witnesses about events related to possible obstruction\u2014spurring the \nPresident to write critical tweets about the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. The President called \nMcGahn at home that night and then called him on Saturday from Camp David. The evidence \naccordingly indicates that news that an obstruction investigation had been opened is what led the \nPresident to call McGahn to have the Special Counsel terminated.  \nThere also is evidence that the President knew that he should not have made those calls to \nMcGahn. The President made the calls to McGahn after McGahn had specifically told the \nPresident that the White House Counsel\u2019s Office\u2014and McGahn himself\u2014could not be involved \nin pressing conflicts claims and that the President should consult with his personal counsel if he \nwished to raise conflicts. Instead of relying on his personal counsel to submit the conflicts claims, \nthe President sought to use his official powers to remove the Special Counsel. And after the media \nreported on the President\u2019s actions, he denied that he ever ordered McGahn to have the Special \nCounsel terminated and made repeated efforts to have McGahn deny the story, as discussed in \nVolume II, Section II.I, infra. Those denials are contrary to the evidence and suggest the \nPresident\u2019s awareness that the direction to McGahn could be seen as improper.  \nF. \nThe President\u2019s Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel Investigation \nOverview \nTwo days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the \nPresident made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, \nthe President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message \nto be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia \ninvestigation to future election interference only. One month later, the President met again with \nLewandowski and followed up on the request to have Sessions limit the scope of the Russia \ninvestigation. Lewandowski told the President the message would be delivered soon. Hours later, \nthe President publicly criticized Sessions in an unplanned press interview, raising questions about \nSessions\u2019s job security. \n1. The President Asks Corey Lewandowski to Deliver a Message to Sessions to \nCurtail the Special Counsel Investigation \nOn June 19, 2017, two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special \nCounsel removed, the President met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign \n90 \n",

Jeff Sessions.  \nThese illegal leaks, like Comey\u2019s, must stop!\u201d643 Approximately one hour later, the President \ntweeted, \u201cSo many people are asking why isn\u2019t the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many \nHillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33,000 e-mails deleted?\u201d644 Later that morning, while aboard \nMarine One on the way to Norfolk, Virginia, the President told Priebus that he had to get Sessions \nto resign immediately.645 The President said that the country had lost confidence in Sessions and \nthe negative publicity was not tolerable.646 According to contemporaneous notes taken by Priebus, \nthe President told Priebus to say that he \u201cneed[ed] a letter of resignation on [his] desk immediately\u201d \nand that Sessions had \u201cno choice\u201d but \u201cmust immediately resign.\u201d647  Priebus replied that if they \nfired Sessions, they would never get a new Attorney General confirmed and that the Department \nof Justice and Congress would turn their backs on the President, but the President suggested he \ncould make a recess appointment to replace Sessions.648 \nPriebus believed that the President\u2019s request was a problem, so he called McGahn and \nasked for advice, explaining that he did not want to pull the trigger on something that was \u201call \nwrong.\u201d649 Although the President tied his desire for Sessions to resign to Sessions\u2019s negative \npress and poor performance in congressional testimony, Priebus believed that the President\u2019s \ndesire to replace Sessions was driven by the President\u2019s hatred of Sessions\u2019s recusal from the \nRussia investigation.650 McGahn told Priebus not to follow the President\u2019s order and said they \nshould consult their personal counsel, with whom they had attorney-client privilege.651 McGahn \n642 Hunt 2/1/18 302, at 23-24; Hunt 7/21/17 Notes, at 1-2. \n643 @realDonaldTrump 7/22/17 (6:33 a.m. ET) Tweet. \n644 @realDonaldTrump 7/22/17 (7:44 a.m. ET) Tweet.

P. 6(e)\nand Priebus discussed the possibility that they would both have to resign rather than carry out the \nPresident\u2019s order to fire Sessions.652 \nThat afternoon, the President followed up with Priebus about demanding Sessions\u2019s \nresignation, using words to the effect of, \u201cDid you get it? Are you working on it?\u201d653  Priebus said \nthat he believed that his job depended on whether he followed the order to remove Sessions, \nalthough the President did not directly say so.654 Even though Priebus did not intend to carry out \nthe President\u2019s directive, he told the President he would get Sessions to resign.655 Later in the day, \nPriebus called the President and explained that it would be a calamity if Sessions resigned because \nPriebus expected that Rosenstein and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would also resign \nand the President would be unable to get anyone else confirmed.656 The President agreed to hold \noff on demanding Sessions\u2019s resignation until after the Sunday shows the next day, to prevent the \nshows from focusing on the firing.657 \nBy the end of that weekend, Priebus recalled that the President relented and agreed not to \nask Sessions to resign.658 Over the next several days, the President tweeted about Sessions.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAnalysis \nIn analyzing the President\u2019s efforts to have Lewandowski deliver a message directing  \nSessions to publicly announce that the Special Counsel investigation would be confined to future \nelection interference, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: \na. \nObstructive act. The President\u2019s effort to send Sessions a message through \nLewandowski would qualify as an obstructive act if it would naturally obstruct the investigation \nand any grand jury proceedings that might flow from the inquiry.   \nThe President sought to have Sessions announce that the President \u201cshouldn\u2019t have a \nSpecial Prosecutor/Counsel\u201d and that Sessions was going to \u201cmeet with the Special Prosecutor to \nexplain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election \nmeddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections.\u201d The President wanted \nSessions to disregard his recusal from the investigation, which had followed from a formal DOJ \nethics review, and have Sessions declare that he knew \u201cfor a fact\u201d that \u201cthere were no Russians \ninvolved with the campaign\u201d because he \u201cwas there.\u201d The President further directed that Sessions \nshould explain that the President should not be subject to an investigation \u201cbecause he hasn\u2019t done \nanything wrong.\u201d Taken together, the President\u2019s directives indicate that Sessions was being \ninstructed to tell the Special Counsel to end the existing investigation into the President and his \ncampaign, with the Special Counsel being permitted to \u201cmove forward with investigating election \nmeddling for future elections.\u201d   \nb. \nNexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President\u2019s \ninitial one-on-one meeting with Lewandowski on June 19, 2017, the existence of a grand jury \ninvestigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. By the time of the \nPresident\u2019s follow-up meeting with Lewandowski, Grand Jury\nSee Volume II, Section II.G, infra. To satisfy the nexus requirement, \nit would be necessary to show that limiting the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation would have the \nnatural and probable effect of impeding that grand jury proceeding. \nc. \nIntent. Substantial evidence indicates that the President\u2019s effort to have Sessions \nlimit the scope of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation to future election interference was intended \nto prevent further investigative scrutiny of the President\u2019s and his campaign\u2019s conduct.   \nAs previously described, see Volume II, Section II.B, supra, the President knew that the \nRussia investigation was focused in part on his campaign, and he perceived allegations of Russian \ninterference to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his election. The President further knew that the \ninvestigation had broadened to include his own conduct and whether he had obstructed justice.  \nThose investigations would not proceed if the Special Counsel\u2019s jurisdiction were limited to future \nelection interference only. \nThe timing and circumstances of the President\u2019s actions support the conclusion that he \nsought that result. The President\u2019s initial direction that Sessions should limit the Special Counsel\u2019s \ninvestigation came just two days after the President had ordered McGahn to have the Special \nCounsel removed, which itself followed public reports that the President was personally under \n97 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ninvestigation for obstruction of justice. The sequence of those events raises an inference that after \nseeking to terminate the Special Counsel, the President sought to exclude his and his campaign\u2019s \nconduct from the investigation\u2019s scope.  The President raised the matter with Lewandowski again \non July 19, 2017, just days after emails and information about the June 9, 2016 meeting between \nRussians and senior campaign officials had been publicly disclosed, generating substantial media \ncoverage and investigative interest. \nThe manner in which the President acted provides additional evidence of his intent. Rather \nthan rely on official channels, the President met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office. The \nPresident selected a loyal \u201cdevotee\u201d outside the White House to deliver the message, supporting \nan inference that he was working outside White House channels, including McGahn, who had \npreviously resisted contacting the Department of Justice about the Special Counsel. The President \nalso did not contact the Acting Attorney General, who had just testified publicly that there was no \ncause to remove the Special Counsel. Instead, the President tried to use Sessions to restrict and \nredirect the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation when Sessions was recused and could not properly \ntake any action on it. \nThe July 19, 2017 events provide further evidence of the President\u2019s intent. The President \nfollowed up with Lewandowski in a separate one-on-one meeting one month after he first dictated \nthe message for Sessions, demonstrating he still sought to pursue the request. And just hours after \nLewandowski assured the President that the message would soon be delivered to Sessions, the \nPresident gave an unplanned interview to the New York Times in which he publicly attacked \nSessions and raised questions about his job security. Four days later, on July 22, 2017, the \nPresident directed Priebus to obtain Sessions\u2019s resignation. That evidence could raise an inference \nthat the President wanted Sessions to realize that his job might be on the line as he evaluated \nwhether to comply with the President\u2019s direction that Sessions publicly announce that, \nnotwithstanding his recusal, he was going to confine the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation to future \nelection interference. \nG. \nThe President\u2019s Efforts to Prevent Disclosure of Emails About the June 9, 2016 \nMeeting Between Russians and Senior Campaign Officials \nOverview \nBy June 2017, the President became aware of emails setting up the June 9, 2016 meeting \nbetween senior campaign officials and Russians who offered derogatory information on Hillary \nClinton as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump.\u201d On multiple occasions \nin late June and early July 2017, the President directed aides not to publicly disclose the emails, \nand he then dictated a statement about the meeting to be issued by Donald Trump Jr. describing \nthe meeting as about adoption.  \nEvidence \n1. The President Learns About the Existence of Emails Concerning the June 9, \n2016 Trump Tower Meeting  \nIn mid-June 2017\u2014the same week that the President first asked Lewandowski to pass a \nmessage to Sessions\u2014senior Administration officials became aware of emails exchanged during \n98 \n",

We discussed a program about \nthe adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years \nago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at \nthat time and there was no follow up.705 \nHicks\u2019s text concluded, \u201cAre you ok with this? Attributed to you.\u201d706 Trump Jr. responded by \ntext message that he wanted to add the word \u201cprimarily\u201d before \u201cdiscussed\u201d so that the statement \nwould read, \u201cWe primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.\u201d707  Trump \nJr. texted that he wanted the change because \u201c[t]hey started with some Hillary thing which was bs \nand some other nonsense which we shot down fast.\u201d708 Hicks texted back, \u201cI think that\u2019s right too \nbut boss man worried it invites a lot of questions[.] [U]ltimately [d]efer to you and [your attorney] \non that word Bc I know it\u2019s important and I think the mention of a campaign issue adds something \nto it in case we have to go further.\u201d709 Trump Jr. responded, \u201cIf I don\u2019t have it in there it appears \nas though I\u2019m lying later when they inevitably leak something.\u201d710 Trump Jr.\u2019s statement\u2014adding \n699 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 3; Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 10. \n700 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 3; see Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 10. \n701 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 4. \n702 Hicks 7/8/17 Notes. \n703 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 4-5; Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 11. \n704 Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 11. \n705 SCR011a_000004 (7/8/17 Text Message, Hicks to Trump Jr.). \n706 SCR011a_000004 (7/8/17 Text Message, Hicks to Trump Jr.). \n707 SCR011a_000005 (7/8/17 Text Message, Trump Jr. to Hicks). \n708 SCR011a_000005 (7/8/17 Text Message, Trump Jr. to Hicks). \n709 SCR011a_000005 (7/8/17 Text Message, Hicks to Trump Jr.). \n710 SCR011a_000006 (7/8/17 Text Message, Trump Jr. to Hicks). \n102 \n",

We primarily \ndiscussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular \nwith American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it \nwas not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.

The Media Reports on the June 9, 2016 Meeting \nBefore the President\u2019s flight home from the G20 landed, the New York Times published \nits story about the June 9, 2016 meeting.717 In addition to the statement from Trump Jr., the Times \nstory also quoted a statement from Corallo on behalf of the President\u2019s legal team suggesting that \nthe meeting might have been a setup by individuals working with the firm that produced the Steele \nreporting.718 Corallo also worked with Circa News on a story published an hour later that \n711 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 6; see Jo Becker et al., Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin \nDuring Campaign, New York Times (July 8, 2017).  \n712 See Jo Becker et al., Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign, New \nYork Times (July 8, 2017). \n713 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 6; Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 9-10. \n714 Hicks 12/7/17 302, at 12; Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 10. \n715 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 7. \n716 Hicks 3/13/18 302, at 7. \n717 See Jo Becker et al., Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign, New \nYork Times (July 8, 2017); Raffel 2/8/18 302, at 10. \n718 See Jo Becker et al., Trump Team Met With Lawyer Linked to Kremlin During Campaign, New \nYork Times (July 8, 2017). \n103 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian attorney. On June 29, Hicks \nwarned the President that the emails setting up the June 9 meeting were \u201creally bad\u201d and the story \nwould be \u201cmassive\u201d when it broke, but the President told her and Kushner to \u201cleave it alone.\u201d  \nEarly on July 8, after Hicks told the President the New York Times was working on a story about \nthe June 9 meeting, the President directed her not to comment, even though Hicks said that the \nPresident usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin. Later that day, the \nPresident rejected Trump Jr.\u2019s draft statement that would have acknowledged that the meeting was \nwith \u201can individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign.\u201d The \nPresident then dictated a statement to Hicks that said the meeting was about Russian adoption \n(which the President had twice been told was discussed at the meeting). The statement dictated \nby the President did not mention the offer of derogatory information about Clinton. \nEach of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed \nat the press. They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by taking these actions, \nsought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigators or the Special Counsel.  \nOn May 17, 2017, the President\u2019s campaign received a document request from SSCI that clearly \ncovered the June 9 meeting and underlying emails, and those documents also plainly would have \nbeen relevant to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation.   \nBut the evidence does not establish that the President took steps to prevent the emails or \nother information about the June 9 meeting from being provided to Congress or the Special \nCounsel. The series of discussions in which the President sought to limit access to the emails and \nprevent their public release occurred in the context of developing a press strategy. The only \nevidence we have of the President discussing the production of documents to Congress or the \nSpecial Counsel is the conversation on June 29, 2017, when Hicks recalled the President \nacknowledging that Kushner\u2019s attorney should provide emails related to the June 9 meeting to \nwhomever he needed to give them to. We do not have evidence of what the President discussed \nwith his own lawyers at that time.   \nb. \nNexus to an official proceeding. As described above, by the time of the President\u2019s \nattempts to prevent the public release of the emails regarding the June 9 meeting, the existence of \na grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge, and the \nPresident had been told that the emails were responsive to congressional inquiries. To satisfy the \nnexus requirement, however, it would be necessary to show that preventing the release of the \nemails to the public would have the natural and probable effect of impeding the grand jury \nproceeding or congressional inquiries. As noted above, the evidence does not establish that the \nPresident sought to prevent disclosure of the emails in those official proceedings.   \nc. \nIntent. The evidence establishes the President\u2019s substantial involvement in the \ncommunications strategy related to information about his campaign\u2019s connections to Russia and \nhis desire to minimize public disclosures about those connections. The President became aware \nof the emails no later than June 29, 2017, when he discussed them with Hicks and Kushner, and \nhe could have been aware of them as early as June 2, 2017, when lawyers for the Trump  \nOrganization began interviewing witnesses who participated in the June 9 meeting. The President \nthereafter repeatedly rejected the advice of Hicks and other staffers to publicly release information \nabout the June 9 meeting. The President expressed concern that multiple people had access to the \nemails and instructed Hicks that only one lawyer should deal with the matter. And the President \n106 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ndictated a statement to be released by Trump Jr. in response to the first press accounts of the June \n9 meeting that said the meeting was about adoption. \nBut as described above, the evidence does not establish that the President intended to \nprevent the Special Counsel\u2019s Office or Congress from obtaining the emails setting up the June 9 \nmeeting or other information about that meeting. The statement recorded by Corallo\u2014that the \nemails \u201cwill never get out\u201d\u2014can be explained as reflecting a belief that the emails would not be \nmade public if the President\u2019s press strategy were followed, even if the emails were provided to \nCongress and the Special Counsel. \nH. \nThe President\u2019s Further Efforts to Have the Attorney General Take Over the \nInvestigation \nOverview \nFrom summer 2017 through 2018, the President attempted to have Attorney General \nSessions reverse his recusal, take control of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, and order an \ninvestigation of Hillary Clinton. \nEvidence \n1. The President Again Seeks to Have Sessions Reverse his Recusal \nAfter returning Sessions\u2019s resignation letter at the end of May 2017, but before the \nPresident\u2019s July 19, 2017 New York Times interview in which he publicly criticized Sessions for \nrecusing from the Russia investigation, the President took additional steps to have Sessions reverse \nhis recusal. In particular, at some point after the May 17, 2017 appointment of the Special Counsel, \nSessions recalled, the President called him at home and asked if Sessions would \u201cunrecuse\u201d \nhimself.736  According to Sessions, the President asked him to reverse his recusal so that Sessions \ncould direct the Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute Hillary Clinton, and the \u201cgist\u201d \nof the conversation was that the President wanted Sessions to unrecuse from \u201call of it,\u201d including \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s Russia investigation.737 Sessions listened but did not respond, and he did \nnot reverse his recusal or order an investigation of Clinton.738 \nIn early July 2017, the President asked Staff Secretary Rob Porter what he thought of \nAssociate Attorney General Rachel Brand.739  Porter recalled that the President asked him if Brand \nwas good, tough, and \u201con the team.\u201d740 The President also asked if Porter thought Brand was \ninterested in being responsible for the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and whether she would want \n736 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 15. That was the second time that the President asked Sessions to \nreverse his recusal from campaign-related investigations. See Volume II, Section II.C.1, supra (describing \nPresident\u2019s March 2017 request at Mar-a-Lago for Sessions to unrecuse).  \n737 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 15. \n738 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 15. \n739 Porter 4/13/18 302, at 11; Porter 5/8/18 302, at 6. \n740 Porter 4/13/18 302, at 11; Porter 5/8/18 302, at 6. \n107 \n",

Where \nis Justice Dept?\u201d755 On October 29, 2017, the President tweeted that there was \u201cANGER & \nUNITY\u201d over a \u201clack of investigation\u201d of Clinton and \u201cthe Comey fix,\u201d and concluded: \u201cDO \nSOMETHING!\u201d756 \nOn December 6, 2017, five days after Flynn pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with \nthe Russian government, the President asked to speak with Sessions in the Oval Office at the end \nof a cabinet meeting.757 During that Oval Office meeting, which Porter attended, the President \nagain suggested that Sessions could \u201cunrecuse,\u201d which Porter linked to taking back supervision of \nthe Russia investigation and directing an investigation of Hillary Clinton.758 \nAccording to \ncontemporaneous notes taken by Porter, the President said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you could un-recuse \nyourself. You\u2019d be a hero. Not telling you to do anything. Dershowitz says POTUS can get \ninvolved. Can order AG to investigate. I don\u2019t want to get involved. I\u2019m not going to get involved.  \nI\u2019m not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.\u201d759 \nAccording to Porter\u2019s notes, Sessions responded, \u201cWe are taking steps; whole new leadership \n752 Porter 5/8/18 302, at 10. \n753 SC_RRP000024 (Porter 10/16/17 Notes); see Porter 5/8/18 302, at 10. \n754 Porter 5/8/18 302, at 10. \n755 @realDonaldTrump 10/18/17 (6:21 a.m. ET) Tweet; @realDonaldTrump 10/18/17 (6:27 a.m. \nET) Tweet. \n756 @realDonaldTrump 10/29/17 (9:53 a.m. ET) Tweet; @realDonaldTrump 10/29/17 (10:02 a.m. \nET) Tweet; @realDonaldTrump 10/29/17 (10:17 a.m. ET) Tweet. \n757 Porter 4/13/18 302, at 5-6; see SC_RRP000031 (Porter 12/6/17 Notes) (\u201c12:45pm With the \nPresident, Gen.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nother campaign-related matters. The inquiry would not turn on what Attorney General Sessions \nwould actually do if unrecused, but on whether the efforts to reverse his recusal would naturally \nhave had the effect of impeding the Russia investigation.    \nOn multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his \nrecusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and \nprosecution of Hillary Clinton. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessions recalled the \nPresident asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive.  When the President \nraised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by Porter, \u201cNot telling \nyou to do anything. . . . I\u2019m not going to get involved.  I\u2019m not going to do anything or direct you \nto do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.\u201d The duration of the President\u2019s efforts\u2014which \nspanned from March 2017 to August 2018\u2014and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized \nSessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is \nrelevant to assessing whether the President\u2019s efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as \nobstructive acts. \nb. Nexus to an official proceeding.  As described above, by mid-June 2017, the existence \nof a grand jury investigation supervised by the Special Counsel was public knowledge. In addition, \nin July 2017, a different grand jury supervised by the Special Counsel was empaneled in the \nDistrict of Columbia, and the press reported on the existence of this grand jury in early August \n2017.776 Whether the conduct towards the Attorney General would have a foreseeable impact on \nthose proceedings turns on much of the same evidence discussed above with respect to the \nobstructive-act element.    \nc. Intent. There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President\u2019s conduct toward \nSessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a \nway that would restrict its scope. By the summer of 2017, the President was aware that the Special \nCounsel was investigating him personally for obstruction of justice. And in the wake of the \ndisclosures of emails about the June 9 meeting between Russians and senior members of the  \ncampaign, see Volume II, Section II.G, supra, it was evident that the investigation into the \ncampaign now included the President\u2019s son, son-in-law, and former campaign manager. The \nPresident had previously and unsuccessfully sought to have Sessions publicly announce that the \nSpecial Counsel investigation would be confined to future election interference. Yet Sessions \nremained recused. In December 2017, shortly after Flynn pleaded guilty, the President spoke to \nSessions in the Oval Office with only Porter present and told Sessions that he would be a hero if \nhe unrecused. Porter linked that request to the President\u2019s desire that Sessions take back \nsupervision of the Russia investigation and direct an investigation of Hillary Clinton. The \nPresident said in that meeting that he \u201cjust want[ed] to be treated fairly,\u201d which could reflect his \nperception that it was unfair that he was being investigated while Hillary Clinton was not. But a \nprincipal effect of that act would be to restore supervision of the Russia investigation to the \nAttorney General\u2014a position that the President frequently suggested should be occupied by \nsomeone like Eric Holder and Bobby Kennedy, who the President described as protecting their \n776 E.g., Del Quentin Wilbur & Byron Tau, Special Counsel Robert Mueller Impanels Washington \nGrand Jury in Russia Probe, Wall Street Journal (Aug. 3, 2017); Carol D.

A reasonable inference from those statements and the President\u2019s actions is that the \nPresident believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could \nshield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation.   \nI. \nThe President Orders McGahn to Deny that the President Tried to Fire the \nSpecial Counsel \nOverview \nIn late January 2018, the media reported that in June 2017 the President had ordered  \nMcGahn to have the Special Counsel fired based on purported conflicts of interest but McGahn \nhad refused, saying he would quit instead. After the story broke, the President, through his \npersonal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove \nthe Special Counsel. Each time he was approached, McGahn responded that he would not refute \nthe press accounts because they were accurate in reporting on the President\u2019s effort to have the \nSpecial Counsel removed. The President later personally met with McGahn in the Oval Office \nwith only the Chief of Staff present and tried to get McGahn to say that the President never ordered \nhim to fire the Special Counsel. McGahn refused and insisted his memory of the President\u2019s \ndirection to remove the Special Counsel was accurate. In that same meeting, the President \nchallenged McGahn for taking notes of his discussions with the President and asked why he had \ntold Special Counsel investigators that he had been directed to have the Special Counsel removed. \nEvidence \n1. The Press Reports that the President Tried to Fire the Special Counsel  \nOn January 25, 2018, the New York Times reported that in June 2017, the President had \nordered McGahn to have the Department of Justice fire the Special Counsel.777 According to the \narticle, \u201c[a]mid the first wave of news media reports that Mr. Mueller was examining a possible \nobstruction case, the president began to argue that Mr. Mueller had three conflicts of interest that \ndisqualified him from overseeing the investigation.\u201d778 The article further reported that \u201c[a]fter \nreceiving the president\u2019s order to fire Mr. Mueller, the White House counsel . . . refused to ask the \nJustice Department to dismiss the special counsel, saying he would quit instead.\u201d779  The article \nstated that the president \u201cultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to \nresign rather than carry out the directive.\u201d780 After the article was published, the President \n777 Michael S.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nhad not backed down and would not budge.828 Following the Oval Office meeting, the President\u2019s \npersonal counsel called McGahn\u2019s counsel and relayed that the President was \u201cfine\u201d with \nMcGahn.829 \nAnalysis \nIn analyzing the President\u2019s efforts to have McGahn deny that he had been ordered to have \nthe Special Counsel removed, the following evidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of \njustice: \na. \nObstructive act. The President\u2019s repeated efforts to get McGahn to create a record \ndenying that the President had directed him to remove the Special Counsel would qualify as an \nobstructive act if it had the natural tendency to constrain McGahn from testifying truthfully or to \nundermine his credibility as a potential witness if he testified consistently with his memory, rather \nthan with what the record said.   \nThere is some evidence that at the time the New York Times and Washington Post stories \nwere published in late January 2018, the President believed the stories were wrong and that he had \nnever told McGahn to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel. The President correctly \nunderstood that McGahn had not told the President directly that he planned to resign. In addition, \nthe President told Priebus and Porter that he had not sought to terminate the Special Counsel, and \nin the Oval Office meeting with McGahn, the President said, \u201cI never said to fire Mueller. I never \nsaid \u2018fire.\u2019\u201d That evidence could indicate that the President was not attempting to persuade \nMcGahn to change his story but was instead offering his own\u2014but different\u2014recollection of the \nsubstance of his June 2017 conversations with McGahn and McGahn\u2019s reaction to them. \nOther evidence cuts against that understanding of the President\u2019s conduct. As previously \ndescribed, see Volume II, Section II.E, supra, substantial evidence supports McGahn\u2019s account \nthat the President had directed him to have the Special Counsel removed, including the timing and \ncontext of the President\u2019s directive; the manner in which McGahn reacted; and the fact that the \nPresident had been told the conflicts were insubstantial, were being considered by the Department \nof Justice, and should be raised with the President\u2019s personal counsel rather than brought to \nMcGahn. In addition, the President\u2019s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the \nSpecial Counsel removed were carefully worded. When first asked about the New York Times \nstory, the President said, \u201cFake news, folks. Fake news.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nmeeting that McGahn\u2019s account differed and that McGahn was firm in his views. Shortly after the \nstory broke, the President\u2019s counsel told McGahn\u2019s counsel that the President wanted McGahn to \nmake a statement denying he had been asked to fire the Special Counsel, but McGahn responded \nthrough his counsel that that aspect of the story was accurate and he therefore could not comply \nwith the President\u2019s request. The President then directed Sanders to tell McGahn to correct the \nstory, but McGahn told her he would not do so because the story was accurate in reporting on the \nPresident\u2019s order. Consistent with that position, McGahn never issued a correction.  More than a \nweek later, the President brought up the issue again with Porter, made comments indicating the \nPresident thought McGahn had leaked the story, and directed Porter to have McGahn create a \nrecord denying that the President had tried to fire the Special Counsel. At that point, the President \nsaid he might \u201chave to get rid of\u201d McGahn if McGahn did not comply. McGahn again refused and \ntold Porter, as he had told Sanders and as his counsel had told the President\u2019s counsel, that the \nPresident had in fact ordered him to have Rosenstein remove the Special Counsel.  That evidence \nindicates that by the time of the Oval Office meeting the President was aware that McGahn did not \nthink the story was false and did not want to issue a statement or create a written record denying \nfacts that McGahn believed to be true.  The President nevertheless persisted and asked McGahn to \nrepudiate facts that McGahn had repeatedly said were accurate. \nb. \nNexus to an official proceeding. By January 2018, the Special Counsel\u2019s use of a \ngrand jury had been further confirmed by the return of several indictments. The President also \nwas aware that the Special Counsel was investigating obstruction-related events because, among \nother reasons, on January 8, 2018, the Special Counsel\u2019s Office provided his counsel with a \ndetailed list of topics for a possible interview with the President.830 The President knew that \nMcGahn had personal knowledge of many of the events the Special Counsel was investigating and \nthat McGahn had already been interviewed by Special Counsel investigators. And in the Oval \nOffice meeting, the President indicated he knew that McGahn had told the Special Counsel\u2019s \nOffice about the President\u2019s effort to remove the Special Counsel. The President challenged \nMcGahn for disclosing that information and for taking notes that he viewed as creating \nunnecessary legal exposure. That evidence indicates the President\u2019s awareness that the June 17, \n2017 events were relevant to the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation and any grand jury investigation \nthat might grow out of it.   \nTo establish a nexus, it would be necessary to show that the President\u2019s actions would have \nthe natural tendency to affect such a proceeding or that they would hinder, delay, or prevent the \ncommunication of information to investigators.  Because McGahn had spoken to Special Counsel \ninvestigators before January 2018, the President could not have been seeking to influence his prior \nstatements in those interviews. But because McGahn had repeatedly spoken to investigators and \nthe obstruction inquiry was not complete, it was foreseeable that he would be interviewed again \non obstruction-related topics. If the President were focused solely on a press strategy in seeking \nto have McGahn refute the New York Times article, a nexus to a proceeding or to further \ninvestigative interviews would not be shown.  But the President\u2019s efforts to have McGahn write a \nletter \u201cfor our records\u201d approximately ten days after the stories had come out\u2014well past the typical \n830 1/29/18 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office, at 1-2 (\u201cIn our \nconversation of January 8, your office identified the following topics as areas you desired to address with \nthe President in order to complete your investigation on the subjects of alleged collusion and obstruction of \njustice\u201d; listing 16 topics). \n119 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ntime to issue a correction for a news story\u2014indicates the President was not focused solely on a \npress strategy, but instead likely contemplated the ongoing investigation and any proceedings \narising from it. \nc. \nIntent. Substantial evidence indicates that in repeatedly urging McGahn to dispute \nthat he was ordered to have the Special Counsel terminated, the President acted for the purpose of \ninfluencing McGahn\u2019s account in order to deflect or prevent further scrutiny of the President\u2019s \nconduct towards the investigation.   \nSeveral facts support that conclusion. The President made repeated attempts to get \nMcGahn to change his story. As described above, by the time of the last attempt, the evidence \nsuggests that the President had been told on multiple occasions that McGahn believed the President \nhad ordered him to have the Special Counsel terminated.  McGahn interpreted his encounter with \nthe President in the Oval Office as an attempt to test his mettle and see how committed he was to \nhis memory of what had occurred. The President had already laid the groundwork for pressing \nMcGahn to alter his account by telling Porter that it might be necessary to fire McGahn if he did \nnot deny the story, and Porter relayed that statement to McGahn. Additional evidence of the \nPresident\u2019s intent may be gleaned from the fact that his counsel was sufficiently alarmed by the \nprospect of the President\u2019s meeting with McGahn that he called McGahn\u2019s counsel and said that \nMcGahn could not resign no matter what happened in the Oval Office that day.  The President\u2019s \ncounsel was well aware of McGahn\u2019s resolve not to issue what he believed to be a false account \nof events despite the President\u2019s request. Finally, as noted above, the President brought up the \nSpecial Counsel investigation in his Oval Office meeting with McGahn and criticized him for \ntelling this Office about the June 17, 2017 events. The President\u2019s statements reflect his \nunderstanding\u2014and his displeasure\u2014that those events would be part of an obstruction-of-justice \ninquiry. \nJ. \nThe President\u2019s Conduct Towards Flynn, Manafort, HOM\nOverview \n. \nIn addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other \nactions directed \nHOM\nat possible witnesses in the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation, including Flynn, \nManafort, \nand as described in the next section, Cohen.  When Flynn withdrew from a joint \ndefense agreement with the President, the President\u2019s personal counsel stated that Flynn\u2019s actions \nwould be viewed as reflecting \u201chostility\u201d towards the President. During Manafort\u2019s prosecution \nand while the jury was deliberating, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort was being treated \nunfairly and made it known that Manafort could receive a pardon. Harm to Ongoing Matter\nEvidence \n1. Conduct Directed at Michael Flynn \nAs previously noted, see Volume II, Section II.B, supra, the President asked for Flynn\u2019s \nresignation on February 13, 2017.

On June 15, 2018, before a scheduled court hearing that day \non whether Manafort\u2019s bail should be revoked based on new charges that Manafort had tampered \nwith witnesses while out on bail, the President told the press, \u201cI feel badly about a lot of them \n846 Indictment, United States v.

Manafort told this Office that he never told Gates that he had talked to \nthe President\u2019s personal counsel or suggested that they would be taken care of. Manafort also said he hoped \nfor a pardon but never discussed one with the President, although he noticed the President\u2019s public \ncomments about pardons. Manafort 10/1/18 302, at 11. As explained in Volume I, Section IV.A.8, supra, \nManafort entered into a plea agreement with our Office.

He thinks Paul Manafort\u2019s been \ntreated unfairly.\u201d867 \nOn August 16, 2018, the Manafort case was submitted to the jury and deliberations began.  \nAt that time, Giuliani had recently suggested to reporters that the Special Counsel investigation \nneeded to be \u201cdone in the next two or three weeks,\u201d868 and media stories reported that a Manafort \nacquittal would add to criticism that the Special Counsel investigation was not worth the time and \nexpense, whereas a conviction could show that ending the investigation would be premature.869 \n861 State of the Union with Jake Tapper Transcript, CNN (June 17, 2018). \n862 See, e.g., Katelyn Polantz, Takeaways from day one of the Paul Manafort trial, CNN (July 31, \n2018); Frank Bruni, Paul Manafort\u2019s Trial Is Donald Trump\u2019s, Too, New York Times Opinion (July 31, \n2018); Rachel Weiner et al., Paul Manafort trial Day 2: Witnesses describe extravagant clothing purchases, \nhome remodels, lavish cars paid with wire transfers, Washington Post (Aug. 1, 2018). \n863 @realDonaldTrump 8/1/18 (9:24 a.m. ET) Tweet.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nOn August 17, 2018, as jury deliberations continued, the President commented on the trial from \nthe South Lawn of the White House. In an impromptu exchange with reporters that lasted \napproximately five minutes, the President twice called the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation a \n\u201crigged witch hunt.\u201d870 When asked whether he would pardon Manafort if he was convicted, the \nPresident said, \u201cI don\u2019t talk about that now. I don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d871 The President then added, \nwithout being asked a further question, \u201cI think the whole Manafort trial is very sad when you look \nat what\u2019s going on there.  I think it\u2019s a very sad day for our country.  He worked for me for a very \nshort period of time. But you know what, he happens to be a very good person. And I think it\u2019s \nvery sad what they\u2019ve done to Paul Manafort.\u201d872  The President did not take further questions.873 \nIn response to the President\u2019s statements, Manafort\u2019s attorney said, \u201cMr. Manafort really \nappreciates the support of President Trump.\u201d874 \nOn August 21, 2018, the jury found Manafort guilty on eight felony counts. Also on \nAugust 21, Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight offenses, including a campaign-finance \nviolation that he said had occurred \u201cin coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for \nfederal office.\u201d875 The President reacted to Manafort\u2019s convictions that day by telling reporters, \n\u201cPaul Manafort\u2019s a good man\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s a very sad thing that happened.\u201d876 The President \ndescribed the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation as \u201ca witch hunt that ends in disgrace.\u201d877  The next \nday, the President tweeted, \u201cI feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family. \u2018Justice\u2019 \ntook a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike \nMichael Cohen, he refused to \u2018break\u2019\u2014make up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019 Such respect for \na brave man!\u201d878 \nIn a Fox News interview on August 22, 2018, the President said:  \u201c[Cohen] makes a better \ndeal when he uses me, like everybody else. And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so \nmuch is he went through that trial\u2014you know they make up stories. People make up stories.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAnalysis \nIn analyzing the President\u2019s conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, HOM\n, the following \nevidence is relevant to the elements of obstruction of justice: \na. \nObstructive act. The President\u2019s actions towards witnesses in the Special Counsel\u2019s \ninvestigation would qualify as obstructive if they had the natural tendency to prevent particular \nwitnesses from testifying truthfully, or otherwise would have the probable effect of influencing, \ndelaying, or preventing their testimony to law enforcement.    \nWith regard to Flynn, the President sent private and public messages to Flynn encouraging \nhim to stay strong and conveying that the President still cared about him before he began to \ncooperate with the government. When Flynn\u2019s attorneys withdrew him from a joint defense \nagreement with the President, signaling that Flynn was potentially cooperating with the \ngovernment, the President\u2019s personal counsel initially reminded Flynn\u2019s counsel of the President\u2019s \nwarm feelings towards Flynn and said \u201cthat still remains.\u201d But when Flynn\u2019s counsel reiterated \nthat Flynn could no longer share information under a joint defense agreement, the President\u2019s \npersonal counsel stated that the decision would be interpreted as reflecting Flynn\u2019s hostility \ntowards the President. That sequence of events could have had the potential to affect Flynn\u2019s \ndecision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues, \nhowever, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about \nthe specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn\u2019s counsel. \nWith respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President\u2019s actions had the potential to \ninfluence Manafort\u2019s decision whether to cooperate with the government. The President and his \npersonal counsel made repeated statements suggesting that a pardon was a possibility for Manafort, \nwhile also making it clear that the President did not want Manafort to \u201cflip\u201d and cooperate with \nthe government. On June 15, 2018, the day the judge presiding over Manafort\u2019s D.C. case was \nconsidering whether to revoke his bail, the President said that he \u201cfelt badly\u201d for Manafort and \nstated, \u201cI think a lot of it is very unfair.\u201d And when asked about a pardon for Manafort, the \nPresident said, \u201cI do want to see people treated fairly.  That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d  Later that day, \nafter Manafort\u2019s bail was revoked, the President called it a \u201ctough sentence\u201d that was \u201cVery \nunfair!\u201d Two days later, the President\u2019s personal counsel stated that individuals involved in the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s investigation could receive a pardon \u201cif in fact the [P]resident and his advisors \n. . . come to the conclusion that you have been treated unfairly\u201d\u2014using language that paralleled \nhow the President had already described the treatment of Manafort. Those statements, combined \nwith the President\u2019s commendation of Manafort for being a \u201cbrave man\u201d who \u201crefused to \u2018break\u2019,\u201d \nsuggested that a pardon was a more likely possibility if Manafort continued not to cooperate with \nthe government. And while Manafort eventually pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation \nagreement, he was found to have violated the agreement by lying to investigators.  \nThe President\u2019s public statements during the Manafort trial, including during jury \ndeliberations, also had the potential to influence the trial jury. On the second day of trial, for \nexample, the President called the prosecution a \u201cterrible situation\u201d and a \u201choax\u201d that \u201ccontinues to \nstain our country\u201d and referred to Manafort as a \u201cReagan/Dole darling\u201d who was \u201cserving solitary \nconfinement\u201d even though he was \u201cconvicted of nothing.\u201d Those statements were widely picked \nup by the press. While jurors were instructed not to watch or read news stories about the case and \n131 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nare presumed to follow those instructions, the President\u2019s statements during the trial generated \nsubstantial media coverage that could have reached jurors if they happened to see the statements \nor learned about them from others. And the President\u2019s statements during jury deliberations that \nManafort \u201chappens to be a very good person\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s very sad what they\u2019ve done to Paul \nManafort\u201d had the potential to influence jurors who learned of the statements, which the President \nmade just as jurors were considering whether to convict or acquit Manafort.   \nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nb. \nNexus to an official proceeding. The President\u2019s actions towards Flynn, Manafort,\nHOM\n \n appear to have been connected to pending or anticipated official proceedings involving \neach individual. The President\u2019s conduct towards FlynnHOM\n \nprincipally occurred when both \nwere under criminal investigation by the Special Counsel\u2019s Office and press reports speculated \nabout whether they would cooperate with the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation. And the President\u2019s \nconduct towards Manafort was directly connected to the official proceedings involving him. The \nPresident made statements about Manafort and the charges against him during Manafort\u2019s criminal \ntrial. And the President\u2019s comments about the prospect of Manafort \u201cflipping\u201d occurred when it \nwas clear the Special Counsel continued to oversee grand jury proceedings. \nc. \nIntent. Evidence concerning the President\u2019s intent related to Flynn as a potential \nwitness is inconclusive. As previously noted, because of privilege issues we do not have evidence \nestablishing whether the President knew about or was involved in his counsel\u2019s communications \nwith Flynn\u2019s counsel stating that Flynn\u2019s decision to withdraw from the joint defense agreement \nand cooperate with the government would be viewed as reflecting \u201chostility\u201d towards the \nPresident. And regardless of what the President\u2019s personal counsel communicated, the President \ncontinued to express sympathy for Flynn after he pleaded guilty pursuant to a cooperation \nagreement, stating that Flynn had \u201cled a very strong life\u201d and the President \u201cfe[lt] very badly\u201d \nabout what had happened to him. \nEvidence concerning the President\u2019s conduct towards Manafort indicates that the President \nintended to encourage Manafort to not cooperate with the government. Before Manafort was \nconvicted, the President repeatedly stated that Manafort had been treated unfairly.  One day after \nManafort was convicted on eight felony charges and potentially faced a lengthy prison term, the \nPresident said that Manafort was \u201ca brave man\u201d for refusing to \u201cbreak\u201d and that \u201cflipping\u201d \u201calmost \nought to be outlawed.\u201d At the same time, although the President had privately told aides he did \nnot like Manafort, he publicly called Manafort \u201ca good man\u201d and said he had a \u201cwonderful family.\u201d  \nAnd when the President was asked whether he was considering a pardon for Manafort, the \nPresident did not respond directly and instead said he had \u201cgreat respect for what [Manafort]\u2019s \ndone, in terms of what he\u2019s gone through.\u201d The President added that \u201csome of the charges they \nthrew against him, every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.\u201d  In light of the \nPresident\u2019s counsel\u2019s previous statements that the investigations \u201cmight get cleaned up with some \npresidential pardons\u201d and that a pardon would be possible if the President \u201ccome[s] to the \nconclusion that you have been treated unfairly,\u201d the evidence supports the inference that the \n132 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nK. \nThe President\u2019s Conduct Involving Michael Cohen \nOverview \nThe President\u2019s conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our \ninvestigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf \nof the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times, \nincluding discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal.  After the media \nbegan questioning Trump\u2019s connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a \u201cparty line\u201d that publicly \ndistanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere \nto that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its \nRussia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the President\u2019s connections to Russia, Cohen \nsubmitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower \nMoscow project three times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen \nhad not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project \nended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the \ncongressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President\u2019s personal counsel, \nwho, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the \nstatement short and \u201ctight.\u201d After the FBI searched Cohen\u2019s home and office in April 2018, the \nPresident publicly asserted that Cohen would not \u201cflip\u201d and privately passed messages of support \nto him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President\u2019s personal counsel and believed that if \nhe stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do \u201csomething else\u201d to make \nthe investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the \nPresident publicly criticized him, called him a \u201crat,\u201d and suggested his family members had \ncommitted crimes. \nEvidence \n1. Candidate Trump\u2019s Awareness of and Involvement in the Trump Tower \nMoscow Project \nThe President\u2019s interactions with Cohen as a witness took place against the background of \nthe President\u2019s involvement in the Trump Tower Moscow project. \nAs described in detail in Volume I, Section IV.A.1, supra, from September 2015 until at \nleast June 2016, the Trump Organization pursued a Trump Tower Moscow project in Russia, with \nnegotiations conducted by Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump Organization and \nspecial counsel to Donald J. Trump.909 \nThe Trump Organization had previously and \n909 In August 2018 and November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple crimes of deception, \nincluding making false statements to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow project, as described later \nin this section. When Cohen first met with investigators from this Office, he repeated the same lies he told \nCongress about the Trump Tower Moscow project. Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 12-17.  But after Cohen pleaded \nguilty to offenses in the Southern District of New York on August 21, 2018, he met with investigators again \nand corrected the record. The Office found Cohen\u2019s testimony in these subsequent proffer sessions to be \nconsistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the Office\u2019s investigation.  \nThe Office\u2019s sentencing submission in Cohen\u2019s criminal case stated: \u201cStarting with his second meeting with \nthe [Special Counsel\u2019s Office] in September 2018, the defendant has accepted responsibility not only for \n134 \n",

Cohen could not recall the precise timing of this conversation, but said \nhe thought it occurred in June or July 2016.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\ndismiss the idea of a substantial connection between Trump and Russia.950 Cohen said that he \ndiscussed the talking points with Trump but that he did not explicitly tell Trump he thought they \nwere untrue because Trump already knew they were untrue.951 Cohen thought it was important to \nsay the deal was done in January 2016, rather than acknowledge that talks continued in May and \nJune 2016, because it limited the period when candidate Trump could be alleged to have a \nrelationship with Russia to an early point in the campaign, before Trump had become the party\u2019s \npresumptive nominee.952 \n3. Cohen Submits False Statements to Congress Minimizing the Trump Tower \nMoscow Project in Accordance with the Party Line \nIn early May 2017, Cohen received requests from Congress to provide testimony and \ndocuments in connection with congressional investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 \nelection.953 At that time, Cohen understood Congress\u2019s interest in him to be focused on the \nallegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russian officials \nin Prague during the campaign.954 Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned \nabout those allegations, which he believed were provably false.955 On May 18, 2017, Cohen met \nwith the President to discuss the request from Congress, and the President instructed Cohen that \nhe should cooperate because there was nothing there.956 \nCohen eventually entered into a joint defense agreement (JDA) with the President and other \nindividuals who were part of the Russia investigation.957 \nIn the months leading up to his \ncongressional testimony, Cohen frequently spoke with the President\u2019s personal counsel.958  Cohen \n950 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 5-6. \n951 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 6. \n952 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 10. \n953 P-SCO-000000328 (5/9/17 Letter, HPSCI to Cohen); P-SCO-000000331 (5/12/17 Letter, SSCI \nto Cohen). \n954 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at 2-3. \n955 Cohen 11/20/18 302, at 2-3. \n956 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2; Cohen 11/20/19 302, at 3.  \n957 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2. \n958 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 2-3; Cohen 11/20/18, at 2-6. Cohen told investigators about his \nconversations with the President\u2019s personal counsel after waiving any privilege of his own and after this \nOffice advised his counsel not to provide any communications that would be covered by any other privilege, \nincluding communications protected by a joint defense or common interest privilege. As a result, most of \nwhat Cohen told us about his conversations with the President\u2019s personal counsel concerned what Cohen \nhad communicated to the President\u2019s personal counsel, and not what was said in response. Cohen described \ncertain statements made by the President\u2019s personal counsel, however, that are set forth in this section. \nCohen and his counsel were better positioned than this Office to evaluate whether any privilege protected \nthose statements because they had knowledge of the scope of their joint defense agreement and access to \nprivileged communications that may have provided context for evaluating the statements they shared. After \ninterviewing Cohen about these matters, we asked the President\u2019s personal counsel if he wished to provide \ninformation to us about his conversations with Cohen related to Cohen\u2019s congressional testimony about \n139 \n",

P. 6(e)\nsaid that in those conversations the President\u2019s personal counsel would sometimes say that he had \njust been with the President.959 Cohen recalled that the President\u2019s personal counsel told him the \nJDA was working well together and assured him that there was nothing there and if they stayed on \nmessage the investigations would come to an end soon.960 At that time, Cohen\u2019s legal bills were \nbeing paid by the Trump Organization,961 and Cohen was told not to worry because the \ninvestigations would be over by summer or fall of 2017.962 Cohen said that the President\u2019s \npersonal counsel also conveyed that, as part of the JDA, Cohen was protected, which he would not \nbe if he \u201cwent rogue.\u201d963 Cohen recalled that the President\u2019s personal counsel reminded him that \n\u201cthe President loves you\u201d and told him that if he stayed on message, the President had his back.964 \nIn August 2017, Cohen began drafting a statement about Trump Tower Moscow to submit \nto Congress along with his document production.965 The final version of the statement contained \nseveral false statements about the project.966 First, although the Trump Organization continued to \npursue the project until at least June 2016, the statement said, \u201cThe proposal was under \nconsideration at the Trump Organization from September 2015 until the end of January 2016.  By \nthe end of January 2016, I determined that the proposal was not feasible for a variety of business \nreasons and should not be pursued further. Based on my business determinations, the Trump \nOrganization abandoned the proposal.\u201d967 Second, although Cohen and candidate Trump had \ndiscussed possible travel to Russia by Trump to pursue the venture, the statement said, \u201cDespite \novertures by Mr. Sater, I never considered asking Mr. Trump to travel to Russia in connection with \nthis proposal. I told Mr. Sater that Mr. Trump would not travel to Russia unless there was a \ndefinitive agreement in place.\u201d968 Third, although Cohen had regularly briefed Trump on the status \nTrump Tower Moscow. The President\u2019s personal counsel declined and, through his own counsel, indicated \nthat he could not disaggregate information he had obtained from Cohen from information he had obtained \nfrom other parties in the JDA. In view of the admonition this Office gave to Cohen\u2019s counsel to withhold \ncommunications that could be covered by privilege, the President\u2019s personal counsel\u2019s uncertainty about \nthe provenance of his own knowledge, the burden on a privilege holder to establish the elements to support \na claim of privilege, and the substance of the statements themselves, we have included relevant statements \nCohen provided in this report.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nmessage to Trump.979  Cohen anticipated he might be asked questions about the proposed Trump-\nPutin meeting when he testified before Congress because he had talked about the potential meeting \non Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show.980 Cohen recalled explaining to the President\u2019s personal counsel \nthe \u201cwhole story\u201d of the attempt to set up a meeting between Trump and Putin and Trump\u2019s role \nin it.981 Cohen recalled that he and the President\u2019s personal counsel talked about keeping Trump \nout of the narrative, and the President\u2019s personal counsel told Cohen the story was not relevant and \nshould not be included in his statement to Congress.982 \nCohen said that his \u201cagenda\u201d in submitting the statement to Congress with false \nrepresentations about the Trump Tower Moscow project was to minimize links between the project \nand the President, give the false impression that the project had ended before the first presidential \nprimaries, and shut down further inquiry into Trump Tower Moscow, with the aim of limiting the \nongoing Russia investigations.983 Cohen said he wanted to protect the President and be loyal to \nhim by not contradicting anything the President had said.984 Cohen recalled he was concerned that \nif he told the truth about getting a response from the Kremlin or speaking to candidate Trump about \ntravel to Russia to pursue the project, he would contradict the message that no connection existed \nbetween Trump and Russia, and he rationalized his decision to provide false testimony because \nthe deal never happened.985 He was not concerned that the story would be contradicted by \nindividuals who knew it was false because he was sticking to the party line adhered to by the whole \ngroup.986 Cohen wanted the support of the President and the White House, and he believed that \nfollowing the party line would help put an end to the Special Counsel and congressional \ninvestigations.987 \nBetween August 18, 2017, when the statement was in an initial draft stage, and August 28, \n2017, when the statement was submitted to Congress, phone records reflect that Cohen spoke with \nthe President\u2019s personal counsel almost daily.988 On August 27, 2017, the day before Cohen \n979 Cohen 11/12/18 302, at 5. \n980 Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 11. \n981 Cohen 3/19/19 302, at 2. \n982 Cohen 3/19/19 302, at 2; see Cohen 9/18/18 302, at 11 (recalling that he was told that if he \nstayed on message and kept the President out of the narrative, the President would have his back). \n983 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 8; Information at 4-5, United States v.

We gathered evidence of the President\u2019s conduct related to Cohen \non two issues: (i) whether the President or others aided or participated in Cohen\u2019s false statements \nto Congress, and (ii) whether the President took actions that would have the natural tendency to \nprevent Cohen from providing truthful information to the government. \ni. \nFirst, with regard to Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress, while there is \nevidence, described below, that the President knew Cohen provided false testimony to Congress \nabout the Trump Tower Moscow project, the evidence available to us does not establish that the \nPresident directed or aided Cohen\u2019s false testimony.   \nCohen said that his statements to Congress followed a \u201cparty line\u201d that developed within \nthe campaign to align with the President\u2019s public statements distancing the President from Russia.  \nCohen also recalled that, in speaking with the President in advance of testifying, he made it clear \nthat he would stay on message\u2014which Cohen believed they both understood would require false \ntestimony. But Cohen said that he and the President did not explicitly discuss whether Cohen\u2019s \ntestimony about the Trump Tower Moscow project would be or was false, and the President did \nnot direct him to provide false testimony. Cohen also said he did not tell the President about the \nspecifics of his planned testimony. During the time when his statement to Congress was being \ndrafted and circulated to members of the JDA, Cohen did not speak directly to the President about \nthe statement, but rather communicated with the President\u2019s personal counsel\u2014as corroborated by \nphone records showing extensive communications between Cohen and the President\u2019s personal \ncounsel before Cohen submitted his statement and when he testified before Congress.   \nCohen recalled that in his discussions with the President\u2019s personal counsel on August 27, \n2017\u2014the day before Cohen\u2019s statement was submitted to Congress\u2014Cohen said that there were \nmore communications with Russia and more communications with candidate Trump than the \nstatement reflected. Cohen recalled expressing some concern at that time. According to Cohen, \nthe President\u2019s personal counsel\u2014who did not have first-hand knowledge of the project\u2014 \nresponded by saying that there was no need to muddy the water, that it was unnecessary to include \nthose details because the project did not take place, and that Cohen should keep his statement short \nand tight, not elaborate, stay on message, and not contradict the President. Cohen\u2019s recollection \nof the content of those conversations is consistent with direction about the substance of Cohen\u2019s \ndraft statement that appeared to come from members of the JDA. For example, Cohen omitted \nany reference to his outreach to Russian government officials to set up a meeting between Trump \nand Putin during the United Nations General Assembly, and Cohen believed it was a decision of \nof conversations beyond that contained in the President\u2019s [written responses to the Special Counsel\u2019s \nOffice].\u201d  2/6/19 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office. \n153 \n",

The President\u2019s \nconversations with his personal counsel were presumptively protected by attorney-client privilege, \nand we did not seek to obtain the contents of any such communications.  The absence of evidence \nabout the President and his counsel\u2019s conversations about the drafting of Cohen\u2019s statement \nprecludes us from assessing what, if any, role the President played.   \nii. \nSecond, we considered whether the President took actions that would have \nthe natural tendency to prevent Cohen from providing truthful information to criminal \ninvestigators or to Congress. \nBefore Cohen began to cooperate with the government, the President publicly and privately \nurged Cohen to stay on message and not \u201cflip.\u201d Cohen recalled the President\u2019s personal counsel \ntelling him that he would be protected so long as he did not go \u201crogue.\u201d In the days and weeks \nthat followed the April 2018 searches of Cohen\u2019s home and office, the President told reporters that \nCohen was a \u201cgood man\u201d and said he was \u201ca fine person with a wonderful family . . . who I have \nalways liked & respected.\u201d Privately, the President told Cohen to \u201chang in there\u201d and \u201cstay \nstrong.\u201d People who were close to both Cohen and the President passed messages to Cohen that \n\u201cthe President loves you,\u201d \u201cthe boss loves you,\u201d and \u201ceveryone knows the boss has your back.\u201d  \nThrough the President\u2019s personal counsel, the President also had previously told Cohen \u201cthanks \nfor what you do\u201d after Cohen provided information to the media about payments to women that, \naccording to Cohen, both Cohen and the President knew was false.  At that time, the Trump \nOrganization continued to pay Cohen\u2019s legal fees, which was important to Cohen. Cohen also \nrecalled discussing the possibility of a pardon with the President\u2019s personal counsel, who told him \nto stay on message and everything would be fine. The President indicated in his public statements \nthat a pardon had not been ruled out, and also stated publicly that \u201c[m]ost people will flip if the \nGovernment lets them out of trouble\u201d but that he \u201cd[idn\u2019t] see Michael doing that.\u201d   \nAfter it was reported that Cohen intended to cooperate with the government, however, the \nPresident accused Cohen of \u201cmak[ing] up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam \n(Taxi cabs maybe?),\u201d called Cohen a \u201crat,\u201d and on multiple occasions publicly suggested that \nCohen\u2019s family members had committed crimes. The evidence concerning this sequence of events \ncould support an inference that the President used inducements in the form of positive messages \nin an effort to get Cohen not to cooperate, and then turned to attacks and intimidation to deter the \nprovision of information or undermine Cohen\u2019s credibility once Cohen began cooperating. \nb. \nNexus to an official proceeding.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nc. \nIntent. In analyzing the President\u2019s intent in his actions towards Cohen as a \npotential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to \ndiscourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen\u2019s information would shed \nadverse light on the President\u2019s campaign-period conduct and statements. \ni.    \nCohen\u2019s false congressional testimony about the Trump Tower Moscow \nproject was designed to minimize connections between the President and Russia and to help limit \nthe congressional and DOJ Russia investigations\u2014a goal that was in the President\u2019s interest, as \nreflected by the President\u2019s own statements. During and after the campaign, the President made \nrepeated statements that he had \u201cno business\u201d in Russia and said that there were \u201cno deals that \ncould happen in Russia, because we\u2019ve stayed away.\u201d As Cohen knew, and as he recalled \ncommunicating to the President during the campaign, Cohen\u2019s pursuit of the Trump Tower \nMoscow project cast doubt on the accuracy or completeness of these statements.   \nIn connection with his guilty plea, Cohen admitted that he had multiple conversations with \ncandidate Trump to give him status updates about the Trump Tower Moscow project, that the \nconversations continued through at least June 2016, and that he discussed with Trump possible \ntravel to Russia to pursue the project. The conversations were not off-hand, according to Cohen, \nbecause the project had the potential to be so lucrative. In addition, text messages to and from \nCohen and other records further establish that Cohen\u2019s efforts to advance the project did not end \nin January 2016 and that in May and June 2016, Cohen was considering the timing for possible \ntrips to Russia by him and Trump in connection with the project. \nThe evidence could support an inference that the President was aware of these facts at the \ntime of Cohen\u2019s false statements to Congress. Cohen discussed the project with the President in \nearly 2017 following media inquiries. Cohen recalled that on September 20, 2017, the day after \nhe released to the public his opening remarks to Congress\u2014which said the project \u201cwas terminated \nin January of 2016\u201d\u2014the President\u2019s personal counsel told him the President was pleased with \nwhat Cohen had said about Trump Tower Moscow. And after Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, the President \ntold reporters that he had ultimately decided not to do the project, which supports the inference \nthat he remained aware of his own involvement in the project and the period during the Campaign \nin which the project was being pursued.     \nii. \nThe President\u2019s public remarks following Cohen\u2019s guilty plea also suggest \nthat the President may have been concerned about what Cohen told investigators about the Trump \nTower Moscow project. At the time the President submitted written answers to questions from \nthis Office about the project and other subjects, the media had reported that Cohen was cooperating \nwith the government but Cohen had not yet pleaded guilty to making false statements to Congress.  \nAccordingly, it was not publicly known what information about the project Cohen had provided \nto the government. In his written answers, the President did not provide details about the timing \nand substance of his discussions with Cohen about the project and gave no indication that he had \ndecided to no longer pursue the project. Yet after Cohen pleaded guilty, the President publicly \nstated that he had personally made the decision to abandon the project. The President then declined \nto clarify the seeming discrepancy to our Office or answer additional questions. The content and \ntiming of the President\u2019s provision of information about his knowledge and actions regarding the \nTrump Tower Moscow project is evidence that the President may have been concerned about the \ninformation that Cohen could provide as a witness.          \n155 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\niii. \nThe President\u2019s concern about Cohen cooperating may have been directed \nat the Southern District of New York investigation into other aspects of the President\u2019s dealings \nwith Cohen rather than an investigation of Trump Tower Moscow.  There also is some evidence \nthat the President\u2019s concern about Cohen cooperating was based on the President\u2019s stated belief \nthat Cohen would provide false testimony against the President in an attempt to obtain a lesser \nsentence for his unrelated criminal conduct. The President tweeted that Manafort, unlike Cohen, \nrefused to \u201cbreak\u201d and \u201cmake up stories in order to get a \u2018deal.\u2019\u201d  And after Cohen pleaded guilty \nto making false statements to Congress, the President said, \u201cwhat [Cohen]\u2019s trying to do is get a \nreduced sentence. So he\u2019s lying about a project that everybody knew about.\u201d But the President \nalso appeared to defend the underlying conduct, saying, \u201cEven if [Cohen] was right, it doesn\u2019t \nmatter because I was allowed to do whatever I wanted during the campaign.\u201d As described above, \nthere is evidence that the President knew that Cohen had made false statements about the Trump \nTower Moscow project and that Cohen did so to protect the President and minimize the President\u2019s \nconnections to Russia during the campaign. \niv.   \nFinally, the President\u2019s statements insinuating that members of Cohen\u2019s \nfamily committed crimes after Cohen began cooperating with the government could be viewed as \nan effort to retaliate against Cohen and chill further testimony adverse to the President by Cohen \nor others.  It is possible that the President believes, as reflected in his tweets, that Cohen \u201cma[d]e[] \nup stories\u201d in order to get a deal for himself and \u201cget his wife and father-in-law . . . off Scott Free.\u201d  \nIt also is possible that the President\u2019s mention of Cohen\u2019s wife and father-in-law were not intended \nto affect Cohen as a witness but rather were part of a public-relations strategy aimed at discrediting \nCohen and deflecting attention away from the President on Cohen-related matters. But the \nPresident\u2019s suggestion that Cohen\u2019s family members committed crimes happened more than once, \nincluding just before Cohen was sentenced (at the same time as the President stated that Cohen \n\u201cshould, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence\u201d) and again just before Cohen was \nscheduled to testify before Congress. The timing of the statements supports an inference that they \nwere intended at least in part to discourage Cohen from further cooperation.   \nL. \nOverarching Factual Issues \nAlthough this report does not contain a traditional prosecution decision or declination \ndecision, the evidence supports several general conclusions relevant to analysis of the facts \nconcerning the President\u2019s course of conduct.  \n1.  Three features of this case render it atypical compared to the heartland obstruction-of-\njustice prosecutions brought by the Department of Justice.   \nFirst, the conduct involved actions by the President. Some of the conduct did not implicate \nthe President\u2019s constitutional authority and raises garden-variety obstruction-of-justice issues. \nOther events we investigated, however, drew upon the President\u2019s Article II authority, which \nraised constitutional issues that we address in Volume II, Section III.B, infra.   A factual analysis \nof that conduct would have to take into account both that the President\u2019s acts were facially lawful \nand that his position as head of the Executive Branch provides him with unique and powerful \nmeans of influencing official proceedings, subordinate officers, and potential witnesses.   \n156 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nSecond, many obstruction cases involve the attempted or actual cover-up of an underlying \ncrime.  Personal criminal conduct can furnish strong evidence that the individual had an improper \nobstructive purpose, see, e.g., United States v. Willoughby, 860 F.2d 15, 24 (2d Cir. 1988), or that \nhe contemplated an effect on an official proceeding, see, e.g., United States v. Binday, 804 F.3d \n558, 591 (2d Cir. 2015). But proof of such a crime is not an element of an obstruction offense.  \nSee United States v. Greer, 872 F.3d 790, 798 (6th Cir. 2017) (stating, in applying the obstruction \nsentencing guideline, that \u201cobstruction of a criminal investigation is punishable even if the \nprosecution is ultimately unsuccessful or even if the investigation ultimately reveals no underlying \ncrime\u201d). Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal \ninterests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, \nor to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same \nregardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.  \nIn this investigation, the evidence does not establish that the President was involved in an \nunderlying crime related to Russian election interference. But the evidence does point to a range \nof other possible personal motives animating the President\u2019s conduct. These include concerns that \ncontinued investigation would call into question the legitimacy of his election and potential \nuncertainty about whether certain events\u2014such as advance notice of WikiLeaks\u2019s release of \nhacked information or the June 9, 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and Russians\u2014 \ncould be seen as criminal activity by the President, his campaign, or his family.   \nThird, many of the President\u2019s acts directed at witnesses, including discouragement of \ncooperation with the government and suggestions of possible future pardons, occurred in public \nview. While it may be more difficult to establish that public-facing acts were motivated by a \ncorrupt intent, the President\u2019s power to influence actions, persons, and events is enhanced by his \nunique ability to attract attention through use of mass communications. And no principle of law \nexcludes public acts from the scope of obstruction statutes. If the likely effect of the acts is to \nintimidate witnesses or alter their testimony, the justice system\u2019s integrity is equally threatened. \n2. Although the events we investigated involved discrete acts\u2014e.g., the President\u2019s \nstatement to Comey about the Flynn investigation, his termination of Comey, and his efforts to \nremove the Special Counsel\u2014it is important to view the President\u2019s pattern of conduct as a whole.  \nThat pattern sheds light on the nature of the President\u2019s acts and the inferences that can be drawn \nabout his intent. \na. Our investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting \nundue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and \nobstruction investigations. The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in \nwhich the President sought to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions \nranged from efforts to remove the Special Counsel and to reverse the effect of the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s recusal; to the attempted use of official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to \ndirect and indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their testimony. Viewing \nthe acts collectively can help to illuminate their significance. For example, the President\u2019s \ndirection to McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed was followed almost immediately by \nhis direction to Lewandowski to tell the Attorney General to limit the scope of the Russia \ninvestigation to prospective election-interference only\u2014a temporal connection that suggests that \nboth acts were taken with a related purpose with respect to the investigation.     \n157 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nThe President\u2019s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is \nlargely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede \nto his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn\u2019s \nprosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General \nthat the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President\u2019s \norder. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President\u2019s message to Sessions that he \nshould confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to \nrecede from his recollections about events surrounding the President\u2019s direction to have the Special \nCounsel removed, despite the President\u2019s multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that \npattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the \nPresident\u2019s aides and associates beyond those already filed.   \nb. In considering the full scope of the conduct we investigated, the President\u2019s actions can \nbe divided into two distinct phases reflecting a possible shift in the President\u2019s motives. In the \nfirst phase, before the President fired Comey, the President had been assured that the FBI had not \nopened an investigation of him personally. The President deemed it critically important to make \npublic that he was not under investigation, and he included that information in his termination \nletter to Comey after other efforts to have that information disclosed were unsuccessful.   \nSoon after he fired Comey, however, the President became aware that investigators were \nconducting an obstruction-of-justice inquiry into his own conduct. That awareness marked a \nsignificant change in the President\u2019s conduct and the start of a second phase of action. The \nPresident launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could \npossess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of \ntargeted efforts to control the investigation. For instance, the President attempted to remove the \nSpecial Counsel; he sought to have Attorney General Sessions unrecuse himself and limit the \ninvestigation; he sought to prevent public disclosure of information about the June 9, 2016 meeting \nbetween Russians and campaign officials; and he used public forums to attack potential witnesses \nwho might offer adverse information and to praise witnesses who declined to cooperate with the \ngovernment. Judgments about the nature of the President\u2019s motives during each phase would be \ninformed by the totality of the evidence.     \n158 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nIII. LEGAL DEFENSES TO THE APPLICATION OF OBSTRUCTION-OF-JUSTICE STATUTES TO \nTHE PRESIDENT \nThe President\u2019s personal counsel has written to this Office to advance statutory and \nconstitutional defenses to the potential application of the obstruction-of-justice statutes to the \nPresident\u2019s conduct.1072 As a statutory matter, the President\u2019s counsel has argued that a core \nobstruction-of-justice statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(c)(2), does not cover the President\u2019s actions.1073 \nAs a constitutional matter, the President\u2019s counsel argued that the President cannot obstruct justice \nby exercising his constitutional authority to close Department of Justice investigations or terminate \nthe FBI Director.1074 Under that view, any statute that restricts the President\u2019s exercise of those \npowers would impermissibly intrude on the President\u2019s constitutional role. The President\u2019s \ncounsel has conceded that the President may be subject to criminal laws that do not directly involve \nexercises of his Article II authority, such as laws prohibiting bribing witnesses or suborning \nperjury.1075 But counsel has made a categorical argument that \u201cthe President\u2019s exercise of his \nconstitutional authority here to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations cannot \nconstitutionally constitute obstruction of justice.\u201d1076 \nIn analyzing counsel\u2019s statutory arguments, we concluded that the President\u2019s proposed \ninterpretation of Section 1512(c)(2) is contrary to the litigating position of the Department of \nJustice and is not supported by principles of statutory construction.   \nAs for the constitutional arguments, we recognized that the Department of Justice and the \ncourts have not definitively resolved these constitutional issues. We therefore analyzed the \nPresident\u2019s position through the framework of Supreme Court precedent addressing the separation \nof powers. Under that framework, we concluded, Article II of the Constitution does not \ncategorically and permanently immunize the President from potential liability for the conduct that \nwe investigated. Rather, our analysis led us to conclude that the obstruction-of-justice statutes can \n1072 6/23/17 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office; see also 1/29/18 \nLetter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office; 2/6/18 Letter, President\u2019s Personal \nCounsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office; 8/8/18 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s \nOffice, at 4. \n1073 2/6/18 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office, at 2-9.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nvalidly prohibit a President\u2019s corrupt efforts to use his official powers to curtail, end, or interfere \nwith an investigation. \nA. \nStatutory Defenses to the Application of Obstruction-Of-Justice Provisions to \nthe Conduct Under Investigation \nThe obstruction-of-justice statute most readily applicable to our investigation is 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1512(c)(2). Section 1512(c) provides:   \n(c) Whoever corruptly\u2014 \n(1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or \nattempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object\u2019s integrity or availability for \nuse in an official proceeding; or \n(2) otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding, or attempts \nto do so, \nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both. \nThe Department of Justice has taken the position that Section 1512(c)(2) states a broad, \nindependent, and unqualified prohibition on obstruction of justice.1077 While defendants have \nargued that subsection (c)(2) should be read to cover only acts that would impair the availability \nor integrity of evidence because that is subsection (c)(1)\u2019s focus, strong arguments weigh against \nthat proposed limitation.  The text of Section 1512(c)(2) confirms that its sweep is not tethered to \nSection 1512(c)(1); courts have so interpreted it; its history does not counsel otherwise; and no \nprinciple of statutory construction dictates a contrary view. On its face, therefore, Section \n1512(c)(2) applies to all corrupt means of obstructing a proceeding, pending or contemplated\u2014 \nincluding by improper exercises of official power. In addition, other statutory provisions that are \npotentially applicable to certain conduct we investigated broadly prohibit obstruction of \nproceedings that are pending before courts, grand juries, and Congress. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1503, \n1505. Congress has also specifically prohibited witness tampering.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b). \n1. The Text of Section 1512(c)(2) Prohibits a Broad Range of Obstructive Acts \nSeveral textual features of Section 1512(c)(2) support the conclusion that the provision \nbroadly prohibits corrupt means of obstructing justice and is not limited by the more specific \nprohibitions in Section 1512(c)(1), which focus on evidence impairment.   \nFirst, the text of Section 1512(c)(2) is unqualified: it reaches acts that \u201cobstruct[], \ninfluence[], or impede[] any official proceeding\u201d when committed \u201ccorruptly.\u201d Nothing in Section \n1512(c)(2)\u2019s text limits the provision to acts that would impair the integrity or availability of \nevidence for use in an official proceeding. In contrast, Section 1512(c)(1) explicitly includes the \nrequirement that the defendant act \u201cwith the intent to impair the object\u2019s integrity or availability \n1077 See U.S. Br., United States v.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nfor use in an official proceeding,\u201d a requirement that Congress also included in two other sections \nof Section 1512. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1512(a)(2)(B)(ii) (use of physical force with intent to cause a \nperson to destroy an object \u201cwith intent to impair the integrity or availability of the object for use \nin an official proceeding\u201d); 1512(b)(2)(B) (use of intimidation, threats, corrupt persuasion, or \nmisleading conduct with intent to cause a person to destroy an object \u201cwith intent to impair the \nintegrity or availability of the object for use in an official proceeding\u201d). But no comparable intent \nor conduct element focused on evidence impairment appears in Section 1512(c)(2). The intent \nelement in Section 1512(c)(2) comes from the word \u201ccorruptly.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. \nMcKibbins, 656 F.3d 707, 711 (7th Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe intent element is important because the word \n\u2018corruptly\u2019 is what serves to separate criminal and innocent acts of obstruction.\u201d) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). And the conduct element in Section 1512(c)(2) is \u201cobstruct[ing], \ninfluenc[ing], or imped[ing]\u201d a proceeding. Congress is presumed to have acted intentionally in \nthe disparate inclusion and exclusion of evidence-impairment language. See Loughrin v. United \nStates, 573 U.S. 351, 358 (2014) (\u201c[W]hen \u2018Congress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another\u2019\u2014let alone in the very next provision\u2014this Court \u2018presume[s]\u2019 \nthat Congress intended a difference in meaning\u201d) (quoting Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, \n23 (1983)); accord Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers, 138 S. Ct. 767, 777 (2018). \nSecond, the structure of Section 1512 supports the conclusion that Section 1512(c)(2) \ndefines an independent offense. Section 1512(c)(2) delineates a complete crime with different \nelements from Section 1512(c)(1)\u2014and each subsection of Section 1512(c) contains its own \n\u201cattempt\u201d prohibition, underscoring that they are independent prohibitions. The two subsections \nof Section 1512(c) are connected by the conjunction \u201cor,\u201d indicating that each provides an \nalternative basis for criminal liability. See Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357 (\u201cordinary use [of \u2018or\u2019] is \nalmost always disjunctive, that is, the words it connects are to be given separate meanings\u201d) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Loughrin, for example, the Supreme Court relied on the use \nof the word \u201cor\u201d to hold that adjacent and overlapping subsections of the bank fraud statute, 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1344, state distinct offenses and that subsection 1344(2) therefore should not be \ninterpreted to contain an additional element specified only in subsection 1344(1). Id.; see also \nShaw v. United States, 137 S. Ct. 462, 465-469 (2016) (recognizing that the subsections of the \nbank fraud statute \u201coverlap substantially\u201d but identifying distinct circumstances covered by \neach).1078 And here, as in Loughrin, Section 1512(c)\u2019s \u201ctwo clauses have separate numbers, line \nbreaks before, between, and after them, and equivalent indentation\u2014thus placing the clauses \nvisually on an equal footing and indicating that they have separate meanings.\u201d  573 U.S. at 359. \nThird, the introductory word \u201cotherwise\u201d in Section 1512(c)(2) signals that the provision \ncovers obstructive acts that are different from those listed in Section 1512(c)(1). See Black\u2019s Law \nDictionary 1101 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cotherwise\u201d means \u201cin a different manner; in another way, or in \nother ways\u201d); see also, e.g., American Heritage College Dictionary Online (\u201c1. In another way; \n1078 The Office of Legal Counsel recently relied on several of the same interpretive principles in \nconcluding that language that appeared in the first clause of the Wire Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084, restricting its \nprohibition against certain betting or wagering activities to \u201cany sporting event or contest,\u201d did not apply \nto the second clause of the same statute, which reaches other betting or wagering activities. See \nReconsidering Whether the Wire Act Applies to Non-Sports Gambling (Nov. 2, 2018), slip op. 7 (relying \non plain language); id. at 11 (finding it not \u201ctenable to read into the second clause the qualifier \u2018on any \nsporting event or contest\u2019 that appears in the first clause\u201d); id. at 12 (relying on Digital Realty). \n161 \n",

Begay v.

The word \n\u201cotherwise\u201d does not signal that Section 1512(c)(2) has less breadth in covering obstructive \nconduct than the language of the provision implies.   \n2. Judicial Decisions Support a Broad Reading of Section 1512(c)(2) \nCourts have not limited Section 1512(c)(2) to conduct that impairs evidence, but instead \nhave read it to cover obstructive acts in any form.\n As one court explained, \u201c[t]his expansive subsection operates as a catch-all to cover \n\u2018otherwise\u2019 obstructive behavior that might not constitute a more specific offense like document \ndestruction, which is listed in (c)(1).\u201d United States v. Volpendesto, 746 F.3d 273, 286 (7th Cir. \n2014) (some quotation marks omitted). For example, in United States v. Ring, 628 F. Supp. 2d \n195 (D.D.C. 2009), the court rejected the argument that \u201c\u00a7 1512(c)(2)\u2019s reference to conduct that \n\u2018otherwise obstructs, influences, or impedes any official proceeding\u2019 is limited to conduct that is \nsimilar to the type of conduct proscribed by subsection (c)(1)\u2014namely, conduct that impairs the \nintegrity or availability of \u2018record[s], documents[s], or other object[s] for use in an official  \nproceeding.\u201d Id. at 224. The court explained that \u201cthe meaning of \u00a7 1512(c)(2) is plain on its \nface.\u201d Id. (alternations in original). And courts have upheld convictions under Section 1512(c)(2) \nthat did not involve evidence impairment, but instead resulted from conduct that more broadly \nthwarted arrests or investigations. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, 862 F.3d 223, 238 (2d Cir. \n2017) (police officer tipped off suspects about issuance of arrest warrants before \u201coutstanding \nwarrants could be executed, thereby potentially interfering with an ongoing grand jury \nproceeding\u201d); United States v. Ahrensfield, 698 F.3d 1310, 1324-1326 (10th Cir. 2012) (officer \ndisclosed existence of an undercover investigation to its target); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d \n1261, 1265 (10th Cir. 2009) (defendant disclosed identity of an undercover officer thus preventing \nhim from making controlled purchases from methamphetamine dealers). Those cases illustrate \nthat Section 1512(c)(2) applies to corrupt acts\u2014including by public officials\u2014that frustrate the \n1079 In Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 15 (2011), the Supreme Court substantially abandoned \nBegay\u2019s reading of the residual clause, and in Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), the Court \ninvalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. Begay\u2019s analysis of the word \u201cotherwise\u201d is \nthus of limited value. \n162 \n",

P. 6(e)\ncommencement or conduct of a proceeding, and not just to acts that make evidence unavailable or \nimpair its integrity.   \nSection 1512(c)(2)\u2019s breadth is reinforced by the similarity of its language to the omnibus \nclause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, which covers anyone who \u201ccorruptly . . . obstructs, or impedes, or \nendeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.\u201d That clause of \nSection 1503 follows two more specific clauses that protect jurors, judges, and court officers. The \nomnibus clause has nevertheless been construed to be \u201cfar more general in scope than the earlier \nclauses of the statute.\u201d United States v. Aguilar, 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995). \u201cThe omnibus clause \nis essentially a catch-all provision which generally prohibits conduct that interferes with the due \nadministration of justice.\u201d United States v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir. 1997). Courts \nhave accordingly given it a \u201cnon-restrictive reading.\u201d  United States v. Kumar, 617 F.3d 612, 620 \n(2d Cir. 2010); id. at 620 n.7 (collecting cases from the Third, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eleventh \nCircuits). As one court has explained, the omnibus clause \u201cprohibits acts that are similar in result, \nrather than manner, to the conduct described in the first part of the statute.\u201d United States v. \nHoward, 569 F.2d 1331, 1333 (5th Cir. 1978). While the specific clauses \u201cforbid certain means \nof obstructing justice . . . the omnibus clause aims at obstruction of justice itself, regardless of the \nmeans used to reach that result.\u201d Id. (collecting cases). Given the similarity of Section 1512(c)(2) \nto Section 1503\u2019s omnibus clause, Congress would have expected Section 1512(c)(2) to cover acts \nthat produced a similar result to the evidence-impairment provisions\u2014i.e., the result of obstructing \njustice\u2014rather than covering only acts that were similar in manner. Read this way, Section \n1512(c)(2) serves a distinct function in the federal obstruction-of-justice statutes: it captures \ncorrupt conduct, other than document destruction, that has the natural tendency to obstruct \ncontemplated as well as pending proceedings.  \nSection 1512(c)(2) overlaps with other obstruction statutes, but it does not render them \nsuperfluous. \nSection 1503, for example, which covers pending grand jury and judicial \nproceedings, and Section 1505, which covers pending administrative and congressional \nproceedings, reach \u201cendeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede\u201d the proceedings\u2014a broader test \nfor inchoate violations than Section 1512(c)(2)\u2019s \u201cattempt\u201d standard, which requires a substantial \nstep towards a completed offense. See United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 302 (2d Cir. 2018) \n(\u201c[E]fforts to witness tamper that rise to the level of an \u2018endeavor\u2019 yet fall short of an \u2018attempt\u2019 \ncannot be prosecuted under \u00a7 1512.\u201d); United States v. Leisure, 844 F.2d 1347, 1366-1367 (8th \nCir. 1988) (collecting cases recognizing the difference between the \u201cendeavor\u201d and \u201cattempt\u201d \nstandards). \nAnd 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, which prohibits destruction of documents or records in \ncontemplation of an investigation or proceeding, does not require the \u201cnexus\u201d showing under \nAguilar, which Section 1512(c)(2) demands. See, e.g., United States v. Yielding, 657 F.3d 688, \n712 (8th Cir. 2011) (\u201cThe requisite knowledge and intent [under Section 1519] can be present even \nif the accused lacks knowledge that he is likely to succeed in obstructing the matter.\u201d); United \nStates v. Gray, 642 F.3d 371, 376-377 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[I]n enacting \u00a7 1519, Congress rejected \nany requirement that the government prove a link between a defendant\u2019s conduct and an imminent \nor pending official proceeding.\u201d). The existence of even \u201csubstantial\u201d overlap is not \u201cuncommon\u201d \nin criminal statutes. Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 359 n.4; see Shaw, 137 S. Ct. at 458-469; Aguilar, 515 \nU.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe fact that there is now some overlap between \u00a7 1503 and \n\u00a7 1512 is no more intolerable than the fact that there is some overlap between the omnibus clause \nof \u00a7 1503 and the other provisions of \u00a7 1503 itself.\u201d).

The Legislative History of Section 1512(c)(2) Does Not Justify Narrowing Its \nText \n\u201cGiven the straightforward statutory command\u201d in Section 1512(c)(2), \u201cthere is no reason \nto resort to legislative history.\u201d United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 6 (1997). In any event, the \nlegislative history of Section 1512(c)(2) is not a reason to impose extratextual limitations on its \nreach. \nCongress enacted Section 1512(c)(2) as part the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. \n107-204, Tit. XI, \u00a7 1102, 116 Stat. 807.   The relevant  section  of the statute was entitled  \n\u201cTampering with a Record or Otherwise Impeding an Official Proceeding.\u201d 116 Stat. 807 \n(emphasis added). That title indicates that Congress intended the two clauses to have independent \neffect. Section 1512(c) was added as a floor amendment in the Senate and explained as closing a \ncertain \u201cloophole\u201d with respect to \u201cdocument shredding.\u201d See 148 Cong. Rec. S6545 (July 10, \n2002) (Sen. Lott); id. at S6549-S6550 (Sen. Hatch). But those explanations do not limit the enacted \ntext. See Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, 488 U.S. 105, 115 (1988) (\u201c[I]t is not the law that a \nstatute can have no effects which are not explicitly mentioned in its legislative history.\u201d); see also \nEncino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 138 S. Ct. 1134, 1143 (2018) (\u201cEven if Congress did not \nforesee all of the applications of the statute, that is no reason not to give the statutory text a fair \nreading.\u201d). The floor statements thus cannot detract from the meaning of the enacted text. See \nBarnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 457 (2002) (\u201cFloor statements from two Senators \ncannot amend the clear and unambiguous language of a statute.  We see no reason to give greater \nweight to the views of two Senators than to the collective votes of both Houses, which are \nmemorialized in the unambiguous statutory text.\u201d).  That principle has particular force where one \nof the proponents of the amendment to Section 1512 introduced his remarks as only \u201cbriefly \nelaborat[ing] on some of the specific provisions contained in this bill.\u201d 148 Cong. Rec. S6550 \n(Sen. Hatch). \nIndeed, the language Congress used in Section 1512(c)(2)\u2014prohibiting \u201ccorruptly . . . \nobstruct[ing], influenc[ing], or imped[ing] any official proceeding\u201d or attempting to do so\u2014 \nparallels a provision that Congress considered years earlier in a bill designed to strengthen \nprotections against witness tampering and obstruction of justice. While the earlier provision is not \na direct antecedent of Section 1512(c)(2), Congress\u2019s understanding of the broad scope of the \n1080 The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Marinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101 (2018), does not \nsupport imposing a non-textual limitation on Section 1512(c)(2). Marinello interpreted the tax obstruction \nstatute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212(a), to require \u201ca \u2018nexus\u2019 between the defendant\u2019s conduct and a particular \nadministrative proceeding.\u201d Id. at 1109. The Court adopted that construction in light of the similar \ninterpretation given to \u201cother obstruction provisions,\u201d id. (citing Aguilar and Arthur Andersen), as well as \nconsiderations of context, legislative history, structure of the criminal tax laws, fair warning, and lenity. Id. \nat 1106-1108. The type of \u201cnexus\u201d element the Court adopted in Marinello already applies under Section \n1512(c)(2), and the remaining considerations the Court cited do not justify reading into Section 1512(c)(2) \nlanguage that is not there. See Bates v. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29 (1997) (the Court \u201cordinarily resist[s] \nreading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.\u201d).   \n164 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nearlier provision is instructive. Recognizing that \u201cthe proper administration of justice may be \nimpeded or thwarted\u201d by a \u201cvariety of corrupt methods . . . limited only by the imagination of the \ncriminally inclined,\u201d S. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 17-18 (1982), Congress considered a \nbill that would have amended Section 1512 by making it a crime, inter alia, when a person  \n\u201ccorruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes . . . [t]he enforcement and prosecution of federal \nlaw,\u201d \u201cadministration of a law under which an official proceeding is being or may be conducted,\u201d \nor the \u201cexercise of a Federal legislative power of inquiry.\u201d  Id. at 17-19 (quoting S. 2420). \nThe Senate Committee explained that: \n[T]he purpose of preventing an obstruction of or miscarriage of justice cannot be fully \ncarried out by a simple enumeration of the commonly prosecuted obstruction offenses.  \nThere must also be protection against the rare type of conduct that is the product of the \ninventive criminal mind and which also thwarts justice.   \nId. at 18. The report gave examples of conduct \u201cactually prosecuted under the current residual \nclause [in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503], which would probably not be covered in this series [of provisions] \nwithout a residual clause.\u201d Id. One prominent example was \u201c[a] conspiracy to cover up the \nWatergate burglary and its aftermath by having the Central Intelligence Agency seek to interfere \nwith an ongoing FBI investigation of the burglary.\u201d Id. (citing United States v. Haldeman, 559 \nF.2d 31 (D.C. Cir. 1976)). The report therefore indicates a congressional awareness not only that \nresidual-clause language resembling Section 1512(c)(2) broadly covers a wide variety of \nobstructive conduct, but also that such language reaches the improper use of governmental \nprocesses to obstruct justice\u2014specifically, the Watergate cover-up orchestrated by White House \nofficials including the President himself. See Haldeman, 559 F.3d at 51, 86-87, 120-129, 162.1081 \n4. General Principles of Statutory Construction Do Not Suggest That Section \n1512(c)(2) is Inapplicable to the Conduct in this Investigation \nThe requirement of fair warning in criminal law, the interest in avoiding due process \nconcerns in potentially vague statutes, and the rule of lenity do not justify narrowing the reach of \nSection 1512(c)(2)\u2019s text.1082 \na. As with other criminal laws, the Supreme Court has \u201cexercised restraint\u201d in interpreting \nobstruction-of-justice provisions, both out of respect for Congress\u2019s role in defining crimes and in \nthe interest of providing individuals with \u201cfair warning\u201d of what a criminal statute prohibits. \nMarinello v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 1101, 1106 (2018); Arthur Andersen, 544 U.S. at 703; \n1081 The Senate ultimately accepted the House version of the bill, which excluded an omnibus \nclause. See United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369, 382-383 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (tracing history of the \nproposed omnibus provision in the witness-protection legislation). During the floor debate on the bill, \nSenator Heinz, one of the initiators and primary backers of the legislation, explained that the omnibus clause \nwas beyond the scope of the witness-protection measure at issue and likely \u201cduplicative\u201d of other \nobstruction laws, 128 Cong. Rec. 26,810 (1982) (Sen. Heinz), presumably referring to Sections 1503 and \n1505.  \n1082 In a separate section addressing considerations unique to the presidency, we consider principles \nof statutory construction relevant in that context.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAguilar, 515 U.S. at 599-602. In several obstruction cases, the Court has imposed a nexus test that \nrequires that the wrongful conduct targeted by the provision be sufficiently connected to an official \nproceeding to ensure the requisite culpability. Marinello, 138 S. Ct. at 1109; Arthur Andersen, \n544 U.S. at 707-708; Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 600-602. Section 1512(c)(2) has been interpreted to \nrequire a similar nexus. See, e.g., United States v. Young, 916 F.3d 368, 386 (4th Cir. 2019); \nUnited States v. Petruk, 781 F.3d 438, 445 (8th Cir. 2015); United States v. Phillips, 583 F.3d \n1261, 1264 (10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Reich, 479 F.3d 179, 186 (2d Cir. 2007).  To satisfy \nthe nexus requirement, the government must show as an objective matter that a defendant acted \n\u201cin a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,\u201d such that the statute \u201cexcludes defendants who have \nan evil purpose but use means that would only unnaturally and improbably be successful.\u201d  \nAguilar, 515 U.S. at 601-602 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id. at 599 (\u201cthe endeavor \nmust have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice\u201d) \n(internal quotation marks omitted). The government must also show as a subjective matter that \nthe actor \u201ccontemplated a particular, foreseeable proceeding.\u201d Petruk, 781 F.3d at 445. Those \nrequirements alleviate fair-warning concerns by ensuring that obstructive conduct has a close \nenough connection to existing or future proceedings to implicate the dangers targeted by the \nobstruction laws and that the individual actually has the obstructive result in mind.   \nb. Courts also seek to construe statutes to avoid due process vagueness concerns. See, e.g., \nMcDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2373 (2016); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, \n368, 402-404 (2010). Vagueness doctrine requires that a statute define a crime \u201cwith sufficient \ndefiniteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\u201d and \u201cin a manner that \ndoes not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d  Id. at 402-403 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  The obstruction statutes\u2019 requirement of acting \u201ccorruptly\u201d satisfies that test.   \n\u201cActing \u2018corruptly\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1512(c)(2) means acting with an improper \npurpose and to engage in conduct knowingly and dishonestly with the specific intent to subvert, \nimpede or obstruct\u201d the relevant proceeding. United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124, 1151 (10th \nCir. 2013) (some quotation marks omitted). The majority opinion in Aguilar did not address the \ndefendant\u2019s vagueness challenge to the word \u201ccorruptly,\u201d 515 U.S. at 600 n. 1, but Justice Scalia\u2019s \nseparate opinion did reach that issue and would have rejected the challenge, id. at 616-617 (Scalia, \nJ., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). \u201cStatutory \nlanguage need not be colloquial,\u201d Justice Scalia explained, and \u201cthe term \u2018corruptly\u2019 in criminal \nlaws has a longstanding and well-accepted meaning.  It denotes an act done with an intent to give \nsome advantage inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.\u201d Id. at 616 (internal  \nquotation marks omitted; citing lower court authority and legal dictionaries). Justice Scalia added \nthat \u201cin the context of obstructing jury proceedings, any claim of ignorance of wrongdoing is \nincredible.\u201d Id. at 617. Lower courts have also rejected vagueness challenges to the word \n\u201ccorruptly.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 869 F.3d 490, 501-502 (7th Cir. 2017); United \nStates v. Brenson, 104 F.3d 1267, 1280-1281 (11th Cir. 1997); United States v. Howard, 569 F.2d \n1331, 1336 n.9 (5th Cir. 1978). This well-established intent standard precludes the need to limit \nthe obstruction statutes to only certain kinds of inherently wrongful conduct.1083 \n1083 In United States v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the court of appeals found the \nterm \u201ccorruptly\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505 vague as applied to a person who provided false information to \nCongress. After suggesting that the word \u201ccorruptly\u201d was vague on its face, 951 F.2d at 378, the court \n166 \n",

The rule has been cited, for example, in adopting a narrow \nmeaning of \u201ctangible object\u201d in an obstruction statute when the prohibition\u2019s title, history, and list \nof prohibited acts indicated a focus on destruction of records. See Yates v. United States, 135 S. \nCt. 1074, 1088 (2015) (plurality opinion) (interpreting \u201ctangible object\u201d in the phrase \u201crecord, \ndocument, or tangible object\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519 to mean an item capable of recording or \npreserving information). Here, as discussed above, the text, structure, and history of Section \n1512(c)(2) leaves no \u201cgrievous ambiguity\u201d about the statute\u2019s meaning. Section 1512(c)(2) \ndefines a structurally independent general prohibition on obstruction of official proceedings. \n5. Other Obstruction Statutes Might Apply to the Conduct in this Investigation \nRegardless whether Section 1512(c)(2) covers all corrupt acts that obstruct, influence, or \nimpede pending or contemplated proceedings, other statutes would apply to such conduct in \npending proceedings, provided that the remaining statutory elements are satisfied.  As discussed \nabove, the omnibus clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503(a) applies generally to obstruction of pending \njudicial and grand proceedings.1084 See Aguilar, 515 U.S. at 598 (noting that the clause is \u201cfar \nmore general in scope\u201d than preceding provisions). Section 1503(a)\u2019s protections extend to \nwitness tampering and to other obstructive conduct that has a nexus to pending proceedings. See \nSampson, 898 F.3d at 298-303 & n.6 (collecting cases from eight circuits holding that Section \n1503 covers witness-related obstructive conduct, and cabining prior circuit authority).  And  \nSection 1505 broadly criminalizes obstructive conduct aimed at pending agency and congressional \nproceedings.1085 See, e.g., United States v. Rainey, 757 F.3d 234, 241-247 (5th Cir. 2014). \nconcluded that the statute did not clearly apply to corrupt conduct by the person himself and the \u201ccore\u201d \nconduct to which Section 1505 could constitutionally be applied was one person influencing another person \nto violate a legal duty. Id. at 379-386. Congress later enacted a provision overturning that result by \nproviding that \u201c[a]s used in [S]ection 1505, the term \u2018corruptly\u2019 means acting with an improper purpose, \npersonally or by influencing another, including by making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, \nconcealing, altering, or destroying a document or other information.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(b). Other courts \nhave declined to follow Poindexter either by limiting it to Section 1505 and the specific conduct at issue in \nthat case, see Brenson, 104 F.3d at 1280-1281; reading it as narrowly limited to certain types of conduct, \nsee United States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 629-630 (D.C. Cir. 1996); or by noting that it predated Arthur \nAndersen\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201ccorruptly,\u201d see Edwards, 869 F.3d at 501-502. \n1084 Section 1503(a) provides for criminal punishment of:  \nWhoever . . . corruptly or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or \ncommunication, influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or \nimpede, the due administration of justice. \n1085  Section 1505 provides for criminal punishment of: \n167 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nFinally, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)(3) criminalizes tampering with witnesses to prevent the \ncommunication of information about a crime to law enforcement. The nexus inquiry articulated \nin Aguilar\u2014that an individual has \u201cknowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial \nproceeding,\u201d 515 U.S. at 599\u2014does not apply to Section 1512(b)(3).  See United States v. Byrne, \n435 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir. 2006). The nexus inquiry turns instead on the actor\u2019s intent to prevent \ncommunications to a federal law enforcement official. See Fowler v. United States, 563 U.S. 668, \n673-678 (2011). \n* \n* \n* \nIn sum, in light of the breadth of Section 1512(c)(2) and the other obstruction statutes, an \nargument that the conduct at issue in this investigation falls outside the scope of the obstruction \nlaws lacks merit.   \nB. \nConstitutional Defenses to Applying Obstruction-Of-Justice Statutes to \nPresidential Conduct \nThe President has broad discretion to direct criminal investigations. The Constitution vests \nthe \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President and enjoins him to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.\u201d   U.S.  CONST. ART II, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3. Those powers and duties form the foundation of \nprosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (Attorney \nGeneral and United States Attorneys \u201chave this latitude because they are designated by statute as \nthe President\u2019s delegates to help him discharge his constitutional responsibility to \u2018take Care that \nthe Laws be faithfully executed.\u2019\u201d). The President also has authority to appoint officers of the \nUnited States and to remove those whom he has appointed. U.S. CONST. ART II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (granting \nauthority to the President to appoint all officers with the advice and consent of the Senate, but \nproviding that Congress may vest the appointment of inferior officers in the President alone, the \nheads of departments, or the courts of law); see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 492-493, 509 (2010) (describing removal authority as \nflowing from the President\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed\u201d).   \nAlthough the President has broad authority under Article II, that authority coexists with \nCongress\u2019s Article I power to enact laws that protect congressional proceedings, federal \ninvestigations, the courts, and grand juries against corrupt efforts to undermine their functions.  \nUsually, those constitutional powers function in harmony, with the President enforcing the \ncriminal laws under Article II to protect against corrupt obstructive acts. But when the President\u2019s \nofficial actions come into conflict with the prohibitions in the obstruction statutes, any \nconstitutional tension is reconciled through separation-of-powers analysis.   \nWhoever corruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, \nobstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending \nproceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due \nand proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is \nbeing had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the \nCongress. \n168 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nThe President\u2019s counsel has argued that \u201cthe President\u2019s exercise of his constitutional \nauthority . . . to terminate an FBI Director and to close investigations . . . cannot constitutionally \nconstitute obstruction of justice.\u201d1086 As noted above, no Department of Justice position or \nSupreme Court precedent directly resolved this issue. We did not find counsel\u2019s contention, \nhowever, to accord with our reading of the Supreme Court authority addressing separation-of-\npowers issues. Applying the Court\u2019s framework for analysis, we concluded that Congress can \nvalidly regulate the President\u2019s exercise of official duties to prohibit actions motivated by a corrupt \nintent to obstruct justice. The limited effect on presidential power that results from that restriction \nwould not impermissibly undermine the President\u2019s ability to perform his Article II functions.      \n1. The Requirement of a Clear Statement to Apply Statutes to Presidential \nConduct Does Not Limit the Obstruction Statutes \nBefore addressing Article II issues directly, we consider one threshold statutory-\nconstruction principle that is unique to the presidency: \u201cThe principle that general statutes must \nbe read as not applying to the President if they do not expressly apply where application would \narguably limit the President\u2019s constitutional role.\u201d OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to \nPresidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. 350, 352 (1995). This \u201cclear \nstatement rule,\u201d id., has its source in two principles:  statutes should be construed to avoid serious \nconstitutional questions, and Congress should not be assumed to have altered the constitutional \nseparation of powers without clear assurance that it intended that result. OLC, The Constitutional \nSeparation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. O.L.C. 124, 178 (1996). \nThe Supreme Court has applied that clear-statement rule in several cases. In one leading \ncase, the Court construed the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq., not to apply \nto judicial review of presidential action. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 800-801 (1992).  \nThe Court explained that it \u201cwould require an express statement by Congress before assuming it \nintended the President\u2019s performance of his statutory duties to be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d  \nId. at 801. In another case, the Court interpreted the word \u201cutilized\u201d in the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. App., to apply only to the use of advisory committees \nestablished directly or indirectly by the government, thereby excluding the American Bar \nAssociation\u2019s advice to the Department of Justice about federal judicial candidates. Public Citizen \nv. United States Department of Justice, 491 U.S. 440, 455, 462-467 (1989). The Court explained \nthat a broader interpretation of the term \u201cutilized\u201d in FACA would raise serious questions whether \nthe statute \u201cinfringed unduly on the President\u2019s Article II power to nominate federal judges and \nviolated the doctrine of separation of powers.\u201d Id. at 466-467. Another case found that an \nestablished canon of statutory construction applied with \u201cspecial force\u201d to provisions that would \nimpinge on the President\u2019s foreign-affairs powers if construed broadly. Sale v. Haitian Centers \nCouncil, 509 U.S. 155, 188 (1993) (applying the presumption against extraterritorial application \nto construe the Refugee Act of 1980 as not governing in an overseas context where it could affect \n\u201cforeign and military affairs for which the President has unique responsibility\u201d). See Application \n1086 6/23/17 Letter, President\u2019s Personal Counsel to Special Counsel\u2019s Office, at 2 n. 1. \n169 \n",

O.L.C. at 353-354 \n(discussing Franklin, Public Citizen, and Sale). \nThe Department of Justice has relied on this clear-statement principle to interpret certain \nstatutes as not applying to the President at all, similar to the approach taken in Franklin. See, e.g., \nMemorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office of the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, \nDeputy Attorney General, Re:  Conflict of Interest Problems Arising out of the President\u2019s \nNomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to \nthe Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (criminal conflict-of-interest statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208, \ndoes not apply to the President). Other OLC opinions interpret statutory text not to apply to certain \npresidential or executive actions because of constitutional concerns. See Application of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 350-357 (consanguinity \nlimitations on court appointments, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458, found inapplicable to \u201cpresidential \nappointments of judges to the federal judiciary\u201d); Constraints Imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913 on \nLobbying Efforts, 13 Op. O.L.C. 300, 304-306 (1989) (limitation on the use of appropriated funds \nfor certain lobbying programs found inapplicable to certain communications by the President and \nexecutive officials).  \nBut OLC has also recognized that this clear-statement rule \u201cdoes not apply with respect to \na statute that raises no separation of powers questions were it to be applied to the President,\u201d such \nas the federal bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201. Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential \nAppointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. OLC explained that \u201c[a]pplication \nof \u00a7 201 raises no separation of powers question, let alone a serious one,\u201d because [t]he \nConstitution confers no power in the President to receive bribes.\u201d Id. In support of that conclusion, \nOLC noted constitutional provisions that forbid increases in the President\u2019s compensation while \nin office, \u201cwhich is what a bribe would function to do,\u201d id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 7), \nand the express constitutional power of \u201cCongress to impeach [and convict] a President for, inter \nalia, bribery,\u201d id. (citing U.S. CONST. ART II, \u00a7 4). \nUnder OLC\u2019s analysis, Congress can permissibly criminalize certain obstructive conduct \nby the President, such as suborning perjury, intimidating witnesses, or fabricating evidence, \nbecause those prohibitions raise no separation-of-powers questions.  See Application of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 357 n.11. \nThe \nConstitution does not authorize the President to engage in such conduct, and those actions would \ntransgress the President\u2019s duty to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d U.S. CONST. \nART II, \u00a7\u00a7 3. In view of those clearly permissible applications of the obstruction statutes to the \nPresident, Franklin\u2019s holding that the President is entirely excluded from a statute absent a clear \nstatement would not apply in this context.   \nA more limited application of a clear-statement rule to exclude from the obstruction statutes \nonly certain acts by the President\u2014for example, removing prosecutors or ending investigations \nfor corrupt reasons\u2014would be difficult to implement as a matter of statutory interpretation. It is \nnot obvious how a clear-statement rule would apply to an omnibus provision like Section \n1512(c)(2) to exclude corruptly motivated obstructive acts only when carried out in the President\u2019s \nconduct of office. No statutory term could easily bear that specialized meaning. For example, the \nword \u201ccorruptly\u201d has a well-established meaning that does not exclude exercises of official power \nfor corrupt ends. Indeed, an established definition states that \u201ccorruptly\u201d means action with an \n170 \n",

And it would be contrary \nto ordinary rules of statutory construction to adopt an unconventional meaning of a statutory term \nonly when applied to the President. See United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) \n(plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (rejecting proposal to \u201cgiv[e] the same word, in the same statutory \nprovision, different meanings in different factual contexts\u201d); cf.  Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 462-\n467 (giving the term \u201cutilized\u201d in the FACA a uniform meaning to avoid constitutional questions). \nNor could such an exclusion draw on a separate and established background interpretive \npresumption, such as the presumption against extraterritoriality applied in Sale. The principle that \ncourts will construe a statute to avoid serious constitutional questions \u201cis not a license for the \njudiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.\u201d  Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, \n59-60 (1997). \u201cIt is one thing to acknowledge and accept . . . well defined (or even newly \nenunciated), generally applicable, background principles of assumed legislative intent. It is quite \nanother to espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes do not have to be read as broadly \nas they are written, but are subject to case-by-case exceptions.\u201d Brogan v. United States, 522 U.S. \n398, 406 (1998). \nWhen a proposed construction \u201cwould thus function as an extra-textual limit on [a statute\u2019s] \ncompass,\u201d thereby preventing the statute \u201cfrom applying to a host of cases falling within its clear \nterms,\u201d Loughrin, 573 U.S. at 357, it is doubtful that the construction would reflect Congress\u2019s \nintent. That is particularly so with respect to obstruction statutes, which \u201chave been given a broad \nand all-inclusive meaning.\u201d Rainey, 757 F.3d at 245 (discussing Sections 1503 and 1505) (internal \nquotation marks omitted). Accordingly, since no established principle of interpretation would \nexclude the presidential conduct we have investigated from statutes such as Sections 1503, 1505, \n1512(b), and 1512(c)(2), we proceed to examine the separation-of-powers issues that could be \nraised as an Article II defense to the application of those statutes.   \n2. Separation-of-Powers Principles Support the Conclusion that Congress May \nValidly Prohibit Corrupt Obstructive Acts Carried Out Through the President\u2019s \nOfficial Powers \nWhen Congress imposes a limitation on the exercise of Article II powers, the limitation\u2019s \nvalidity depends on whether the measure \u201cdisrupts the balance between the coordinate branches.\u201d  \nNixon v. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. 425, 443 (1977). \u201cEven when a branch does \nnot arrogate power to itself, . . . the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair \nanother in the performance of its constitutional duties.\u201d Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, \n757 (1996). The \u201cseparation of powers does not mean,\u201d however, \u201cthat the branches \u2018ought to \nhave no partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of each other.\u2019\u201d  Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. \n681, 703 (1997) (quoting James Madison, The Federalist No. 47, pp. 325\u2013326 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) \n(emphasis omitted)). In this context, a balancing test applies to assess separation-of-powers issues.  \nApplying that test here, we concluded that Congress can validly make obstruction-of-justice \nstatutes applicable to corruptly motivated official acts of the President without impermissibly \nundermining his Article II functions. \n171 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\na. The Supreme Court\u2019s Separation-of-Powers Balancing Test Applies \nIn This Context \nA congressionally imposed limitation on presidential action is assessed to determine \u201cthe \nextent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned \nfunctions,\u201d and, if the \u201cpotential for disruption is present[,] . . . whether that impact is justified by \nan overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.\u201d \nAdministrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443; see Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731,753-\n754 (1982); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 706-707 (1974). That balancing test applies to \na congressional regulation of presidential power through the obstruction-of-justice laws. 1087 \nWhen an Article II power has not been \u201cexplicitly assigned by the text of the Constitution \nto be within the sole province of the President, but rather was thought to be encompassed within \nthe general grant to the President of the \u2018executive Power,\u2019\u201d the Court has balanced competing \nconstitutional considerations. Public Citizen, 491 U.S. at 484 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the \njudgment, joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, J.). As Justice Kennedy noted in Public \nCitizen, the Court has applied a balancing test to restrictions on \u201cthe President\u2019s power to remove \nExecutive officers, a power [that] . . . is not conferred by any explicit provision in the text of the \nConstitution (as is the appointment power), but rather is inferred to be a necessary part of the grant \nof the \u2018executive Power.\u2019\u201d  Id. (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 694 (1988), and Myers v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52, 115\u2013116 (1926)). Consistent with that statement, Morrison sustained \na good-cause limitation on the removal of an inferior officer with defined prosecutorial \nresponsibilities after determining that the limitation did not impermissibly undermine the \nPresident\u2019s ability to perform his Article II functions. 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696. The Court \nhas also evaluated other general executive-power claims through a balancing test. For example, \nthe Court evaluated the President\u2019s claim of an absolute privilege for presidential communications \nabout his official acts by balancing that interest against the Judicial Branch\u2019s need for evidence in \na criminal case. United States v. Nixon, supra (recognizing a qualified constitutional privilege for \npresidential communications on official matters). The Court has also upheld a law that provided \nfor archival access to presidential records despite a claim of absolute presidential privilege over \nthe records. Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443-445, 451-455. The analysis in \nthose cases supports applying a balancing test to assess the constitutionality of applying the \nobstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential exercises of executive power.  \nOnly in a few instances has the Court applied a different framework. When the President\u2019s \npower is \u201cboth \u2018exclusive\u2019 and \u2018conclusive\u2019 on the issue,\u201d Congress is precluded from regulating \nits exercise. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 135 S. Ct. 2076, 2084 (2015). In Zivotofsky, for example, the \nCourt followed \u201cJustice Jackson\u2019s familiar tripartite framework\u201d in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. \nv. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring), and held that the President\u2019s \n1087 OLC applied such a balancing test in concluding that the President is not subject to criminal \nprosecution while in office, relying on many of the same precedents discussed in this section. See A Sitting \nPresident\u2019s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. 222, 237-238, 244-245 \n(2000) (relying on, inter alia, United States v. Nixon, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and Clinton v. Jones, and quoting \nthe legal standard from Administrator of General Services v. Nixon that is applied in the text). OLC \nrecognized that \u201c[t]he balancing analysis\u201d it had initially relied on in finding that a sitting President is \nimmune from prosecution had \u201cbeen adopted as the appropriate mode of analysis by the Court.\u201d Id. at 244.  \n172 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nauthority to recognize foreign nations is exclusive. Id. at 2083, 2094. See also Public Citizen 491 \nU.S. at 485-486 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment) (citing the power to grant pardons under \nU.S. CONST., ART. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1, and the Presentment Clauses for legislation, U.S. CONST., ART. I, \n\u00a7 7, Cls. 2, 3, as examples of exclusive presidential powers by virtue of constitutional text).  \nBut even when a power is exclusive, \u201cCongress\u2019 powers, and its central role in making \nlaws, give it substantial authority regarding many of the policy determinations that precede and \nfollow\u201d the President\u2019s act. Zivotofsky, 135 S. Ct. at 2087. For example, although the President\u2019s \npower to grant pardons is exclusive and not subject to congressional regulation, see United States \nv. Klein, 80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 128, 147-148 (1872), Congress has the authority to prohibit the corrupt \nuse of \u201canything of value\u201d to influence the testimony of another person in a judicial, congressional, \nor agency proceeding, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(3)\u2014which would include the offer or promise of a \npardon to induce a person to testify falsely or not to testify at all. The offer of a pardon would \nprecede the act of pardoning and thus be within Congress\u2019s power to regulate even if the pardon \nitself is not. Just as the Speech or Debate Clause, U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 6, cl.1, absolutely protects \nlegislative acts, but not a legislator\u2019s \u201ctaking or agreeing to take money for a promise to act in a \ncertain way . . . for it is taking the bribe, not performance of the illicit compact, that is a criminal \nact,\u201d United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 526 (1972) (emphasis omitted), the promise of a \npardon to corruptly influence testimony would not be a constitutionally immunized act. The \napplication of obstruction statutes to such promises therefore would raise no serious separation-\nof-powers issue. \nb. The Effect of Obstruction-of-Justice Statutes on the President\u2019s \nCapacity to Perform His Article II Responsibilities is Limited \nUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s balancing test for analyzing separation-of-powers issues, the \nfirst task is to assess the degree to which applying obstruction-of-justice statutes to presidential \nactions affects the President\u2019s ability to carry out his Article II responsibilities.  Administrator of \nGeneral Services, 433 U.S. at 443. As discussed above, applying obstruction-of-justice statutes \nto presidential conduct that does not involve the President\u2019s conduct of office\u2014such as influencing \nthe testimony of witnesses\u2014is constitutionally unproblematic. The President has no more right \nthan other citizens to impede official proceedings by corruptly influencing witness testimony. The \nconduct would be equally improper whether effectuated through direct efforts to produce false \ntestimony or suppress the truth, or through the actual, threatened, or promised use of official \npowers to achieve the same result.      \nThe President\u2019s action in curtailing criminal investigations or prosecutions, or discharging \nlaw enforcement officials, raises different questions.   Each type of action involves the exercise of \nexecutive discretion in furtherance of the President\u2019s duty to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.\u201d U.S. CONST., ART. II, \u00a7 3. Congress may not supplant the President\u2019s exercise of \nexecutive power to supervise prosecutions or to remove officers who occupy law enforcement \npositions. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 726-727 (1986) (\u201cCongress cannot reserve for \nitself the power of removal of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by \nimpeachment. . . . [Because t]he structure of the Constitution does not permit Congress to execute \nthe laws, . . . [t]his kind of congressional control over the execution of the laws . . . is \nconstitutionally impermissible.\u201d). Yet the obstruction-of-justice statutes do not aggrandize power \nin Congress or usurp executive authority. Instead, they impose a discrete limitation on conduct \n173 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nonly when it is taken with the \u201ccorrupt\u201d intent to obstruct justice. The obstruction statutes thus \nwould restrict presidential action only by prohibiting the President from acting to obstruct official \nproceedings for the improper purpose of protecting his own interests. See Volume II, Section \nIII.A.3, supra. \nThe direct effect on the President\u2019s freedom of action would correspondingly be a limited \none. A preclusion of \u201ccorrupt\u201d official action is not a major intrusion on Article II powers. For \nexample, the proper supervision of criminal law does not demand freedom for the President to act \nwith the intention of shielding himself from criminal punishment, avoiding financial liability, or \npreventing personal embarrassment. To the contrary, a statute that prohibits official action \nundertaken for such personal purposes furthers, rather than hinders, the impartial and evenhanded \nadministration of the law. And the Constitution does not mandate that the President have \nunfettered authority to direct investigations or prosecutions, with no limits whatsoever, in order to \ncarry out his Article II functions. See Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 833 (1985) (\u201cCongress \nmay limit an agency\u2019s exercise of enforcement power if it wishes, either by setting substantive \npriorities, or by otherwise circumscribing an agency\u2019s power to discriminate among issues or cases \nit will pursue.\u201d); United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 707 (\u201c[t]o read the Art. II powers of the \nPresident as providing an absolute privilege [to withhold confidential communications from a \ncriminal trial]. . . would upset the constitutional balance of \u2018a workable government\u2019 and gravely \nimpair the role of the courts under Art. III\u201d).   \nNor must the President have unfettered authority to remove all Executive Branch officials \ninvolved in the execution of the laws. The Constitution establishes that Congress has legislative \nauthority to structure the Executive Branch by authorizing Congress to create executive \ndepartments and officer positions and to specify how inferior officers are appointed. E.g., U.S. \nCONST., ART. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 18 (Necessary and Proper Clause); ART. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 1 (Opinions Clause); \nART. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (Appointments Clause); see Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. While the \nPresident\u2019s removal power is an important means of ensuring that officers faithfully execute the \nlaw, Congress has a recognized authority to place certain limits on removal.  Id. at 493-495. \nThe President\u2019s removal powers are at their zenith with respect to principal officers\u2014that \nis, officers who must be appointed by the President and who report to him directly. See Free \nEnterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493, 500. The President\u2019s \u201cexclusive and illimitable power of \nremoval\u201d of those principal officers furthers \u201cthe President\u2019s ability to ensure that the laws are \nfaithfully executed.\u201d Id. at 493, 498 (internal quotation marks omitted); Myers, 272 U.S. at 627.  \nThus, \u201cthere are some \u2018purely executive\u2019 officials who must be removable by the President at will \nif he is able to accomplish his constitutional role.\u201d  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 690; Myers, 272 U.S. at \n134 (the President\u2019s \u201ccabinet officers must do his will,\u201d and \u201c[t]he moment that he loses confidence \nin the intelligence, ability, judgment, or loyalty of any one of them, he must have the power to \nremove him without delay\u201d); cf. Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) \n(Congress has the power to create independent agencies headed by principal officers removable \nonly for good cause). In light of those constitutional precedents, it may be that the obstruction \nstatutes could not be constitutionally applied to limit the removal of a cabinet officer such as the \nAttorney General. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 101; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 503.

The Supreme \nCourt has long recognized Congress\u2019s authority to place for-cause limitations on the President\u2019s \nremoval of \u201cinferior Officers\u201d whose appointment may be vested in the head of a department.  U.S. \nCONST. ART. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2. See United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886) (\u201cThe \nconstitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment [of inferior officers in the heads \nof departments] implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as \nCongress may enact in relation to the officers so appointed\u201d) (quoting lower court decision); \nMorrison, 487 U.S. at 689 n. 27 (citing Perkins); accord id. at 723-724 & n.4 (Scalia, J., dissenting) \n(recognizing that Perkins is \u201cestablished\u201d law); see also Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 493-\n495 (citing Perkins and Morrison). The category of inferior officers includes both the FBI Director \nand the Special Counsel, each of whom reports to the Attorney General. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 509, \n515(a), 531; 28 C.F.R. Part 600. Their work is thus \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a presidentially-\nappointed, Senate-confirmed officer. See In re: Grand Jury Investigation, __ F.3d __, 2019 WL \n921692, at *3-*4 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 26, 2019) (holding that the Special Counsel is an \u201cinferior officer\u201d \nfor constitutional purposes). \nWhere the Constitution permits Congress to impose a good-cause limitation on the removal \nof an Executive Branch officer, the Constitution should equally permit Congress to bar removal \nfor the corrupt purpose of obstructing justice. \nLimiting the range of permissible reasons for \nremoval to exclude a \u201ccorrupt\u201d purpose imposes a lesser restraint on the President than requiring \nan affirmative showing of good cause. It follows that for such inferior officers, Congress may \nconstitutionally restrict the President\u2019s removal authority if that authority was exercised for the \ncorrupt purpose of obstructing justice. And even if a particular inferior officer\u2019s position might be \nof such importance to the execution of the laws that the President must have at-will removal \nauthority, the obstruction-of-justice statutes could still be constitutionally applied to forbid \nremoval for a corrupt reason.1088 A narrow and discrete limitation on removal that precluded \ncorrupt action would leave ample room for all other considerations, including disagreement over \npolicy or loss of confidence in the officer\u2019s judgment or commitment. A corrupt-purpose \nprohibition therefore would not undermine the President\u2019s ability to perform his Article II \nfunctions. Accordingly, because the separation-of-powers question is \u201cwhether the removal \nrestrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President\u2019s ability to perform his \nconstitutional duty,\u201d Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691, a restriction on removing an inferior officer for a \n1088 Although the FBI director is an inferior officer, he is appointed by the President and removable \nby him at will, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 532 note, and it is not clear that Congress could constitutionally provide the \nFBI director with good-cause tenure protection. See OLC, Constitutionality of Legislation Extending the \nTerm of the FBI Director, 2011 WL 2566125, at *3 (O.L.C. June 20, 2011) (\u201ctenure protection for an officer \nwith the FBI Director\u2019s broad investigative, administrative, and policymaking responsibilities would raise \na serious constitutional question whether Congress had \u2018impede[d] the President\u2019s ability to perform his \nconstitutional duty\u2019 to take care that the laws be faithfully executed\u201d) (quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691). \n175 \n",

The President retains broad latitude to \nsupervise investigations and remove officials, circumscribed in this context only by the \nrequirement that he not act for corrupt personal purposes.1089 \nc. Congress Has Power to Protect Congressional, Grand Jury, and \nJudicial Proceedings Against Corrupt Acts from Any Source \nWhere a law imposes a burden on the President\u2019s performance of Article II functions, \nseparation-of-powers analysis considers whether the statutory measure \u201cis justified by an \noverriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress.\u201d  \nAdministrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 443. Here, Congress enacted the obstruction-of-\njustice statutes to protect, among other things, the integrity of its own proceedings, grand jury \ninvestigations, and federal criminal trials. Those objectives are within Congress\u2019s authority and \nserve strong governmental interests.    \ni. Congress has Article I authority to define generally applicable criminal law and apply it \nto all persons\u2014including the President. Congress clearly has authority to protect its own \nlegislative functions against corrupt efforts designed to impede legitimate fact-gathering and \nlawmaking efforts. See Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 187, 206-207 (1957); Chapman \nv. United States, 5 App. D.C. 122, 130 (1895). Congress also has authority to establish a system \nof federal courts, which includes the power to protect the judiciary against obstructive acts. See \nU.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 8, cls. 9, 18 (\u201cThe Congress shall have Power . . . To constitute Tribunals \ninferior to the supreme Court\u201d and \u201cTo make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for \ncarrying into Execution the foregoing powers\u201d). The long lineage of the obstruction-of-justice \nstatutes, which can be traced to at least 1831, attests to the necessity for that protection. See An \nAct Declaratory of the Law Concerning Contempts of Court, 4 Stat. 487-488 \u00a7 2 (1831) (making \nit a crime if \u201cany person or persons  shall corruptly . . . endeavor to influence, intimidate, or impede \nany juror, witness, or officer, in any court of the United States, in the discharge of his duty, or \nshall, corruptly . . . obstruct, or impede, or endeavor to obstruct or impede, the due administration \nof justice therein\u201d). \nii. The Article III courts have an equally strong interest in being protected against \nobstructive acts, whatever their source. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Nixon, \na \u201cprimary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch\u201d is \u201cto do justice in criminal prosecutions.\u201d  \n418 U.S. at 707; accord Cheney v. United States District Court for the District of Columbia, 542 \nU.S. 367, 384 (2004). In Nixon, the Court rejected the President\u2019s claim of absolute executive \nprivilege because \u201cthe allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably \n1089 The obstruction statutes do not disqualify the President from acting in a case simply because \nhe has a personal interest in it or because his own conduct may be at issue. As the Department of Justice \nhas made clear, a claim of a conflict of interest, standing alone, cannot deprive the President of the ability \nto fulfill his constitutional function. See, e.g., OLC, Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential \nAppointments of Federal Judges, 19 O.L.C. Op. at 356 (citing Memorandum for Richard T. Burress, Office \nof the President, from Laurence H. Silberman, Deputy Attorney General, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems \nArising out of the President\u2019s Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller to be Vice President under the Twenty-\nFifth Amendment to the Constitution, at 2, 5 (Aug. 28, 1974)).  \n176 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nrelevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely \nimpair the basic function of the courts.\u201d 407 U.S. at 712. As Nixon illustrates, the need to \nsafeguard judicial integrity is a compelling constitutional interest. See id. at 709 (noting that the \ndenial of full disclosure of the facts surrounding relevant presidential communications threatens \n\u201c[t]he very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system\u201d).   \niii. Finally, the grand jury cannot achieve its constitutional purpose absent protection from \ncorrupt acts. Serious federal criminal charges generally reach the Article III courts based on an \nindictment issued by a grand jury. Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.S. 323, 327 (1940) (\u201cThe \nConstitution itself makes the grand jury a part of the judicial process.\u201d). And the grand jury\u2019s \nfunction is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment. U.S. CONST. AMEND. V. (\u201c[n]o person shall be held \nto answer\u201d for a serious crime \u201cunless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury\u201d). \u201c[T]he \nwhole theory of [the grand jury\u2019s] function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional \ngovernment, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the people,\u201d \nUnited States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 47 (1992), \u201cpledged to indict no one because of prejudice \nand to free no one because of special favor.\u201d Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 362 (1956).  \nIf the grand jury were not protected against corrupt interference from all persons, its function as \nan independent charging body would be thwarted. And an impartial grand jury investigation to \ndetermine whether probable cause exists to indict is vital to the criminal justice process.   \n* \n* \n* \nThe final step in the constitutional balancing process is to assess whether the separation-\nof-powers doctrine permits Congress to take action within its constitutional authority \nnotwithstanding the potential impact on Article II functions. See Administrator of General \nServices, 433 U.S. at 443; see also Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691-693, 695-696; United States v. Nixon, \n418 U.S. at 711-712. In the case of the obstruction-of-justice statutes, our assessment of the \nweighing of interests leads us to conclude that Congress has the authority to impose the limited \nrestrictions contained in those statutes on the President\u2019s official conduct to protect the integrity \nof important functions of other branches of government.   \nA general ban on corrupt action does not unduly intrude on the President\u2019s responsibility \nto \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d U.S. CONST. ART II, \u00a7\u00a7 3.1090 To the contrary, \nthe concept of \u201cfaithful execution\u201d connotes the use of power in the interest of the public, not in \nthe office holder\u2019s personal interests. See 1 Samuel Johnson, A Dictionary of the English \nLanguage 763 (1755) (\u201cfaithfully\u201d def. 3: \u201c[w]ith strict adherence to duty and allegiance\u201d). And \nimmunizing the President from the generally applicable criminal prohibition against corrupt \nobstruction of official proceedings would seriously impair Congress\u2019s power to enact laws \u201cto \npromote objectives within [its] constitutional authority,\u201d Administrator of General Services, 433 \nU.S. at 425\u2014i.e., protecting the integrity of its own proceedings and the proceedings of Article III \ncourts and grand juries. \n1090 As noted above, the President\u2019s selection and removal of principal executive officers may have \na unique constitutional status.  \n177 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nAccordingly, based on the analysis above, we were not persuaded by the argument that the \nPresident has blanket constitutional immunity to engage in acts that would corruptly obstruct \njustice through the exercise of otherwise-valid Article II powers. 1091 \n3. Ascertaining Whether the President Violated the Obstruction Statutes Would \nNot Chill his Performance of his Article II Duties  \nApplying the obstruction statutes to the President\u2019s official conduct would involve \ndetermining as a factual matter whether he engaged in an obstructive act, whether the act had a \nnexus to official proceedings, and whether he was motivated by corrupt intent.  But applying those \nstandards to the President\u2019s official conduct should not hinder his ability to perform his Article II \nduties. Cf. Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 752-753 & n.32 (taking into account chilling effect on \nthe President in adopting a constitutional rule of presidential immunity from private civil damages \naction based on official duties). Several safeguards would prevent a chilling effect: the existence \nof settled legal standards, the presumption of regularity in prosecutorial actions, and the existence \nof evidentiary limitations on probing the President\u2019s motives. And historical experience confirms \nthat no impermissible chill should exist. \na.  As an initial matter, the term \u201ccorruptly\u201d sets a demanding standard. It requires a \nconcrete showing that a person acted with an intent to obtain an \u201cimproper advantage for [him]self \nor someone else, inconsistent with official duty and the rights of others.\u201d  BALLENTINE\u2019S LAW \nDICTIONARY 276 (3d ed. 1969); see United States v. Pasha, 797 F.3d 1122, 1132 (D.C. Cir. 2015); \nAguilar, 515 U.S. at 616 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). That standard \nparallels the President\u2019s constitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws. And \nvirtually everything that the President does in the routine conduct of office will have a clear \ngovernmental purpose and will not be contrary to his official duty. Accordingly, the President has \nno reason to be chilled in those actions because, in virtually all instances, there will be no credible \nbasis for suspecting a corrupt personal motive.    \nThat point is illustrated by examples of conduct that would and would not satisfy the \nstringent corrupt-motive standard. Direct or indirect action by the President to end a criminal \ninvestigation into his own or his family members\u2019 conduct to protect against personal \nembarrassment or legal liability would constitute a core example of corruptly motivated conduct.  \nSo too would action to halt an enforcement proceeding that directly and adversely affected the \nPresident\u2019s financial interests for the purpose of protecting those interests. In those examples, \n1091 A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not substitute for potential \ncriminal liability after a President leaves office. Impeachment would remove a President from office, but \nwould not address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual purposes of the criminal law.  \nIndeed, the Impeachment Judgment Clause recognizes that criminal law plays an independent role in \naddressing an official\u2019s conduct, distinct from the political remedy of impeachment. See U.S. CONST. ART. \nI, \u00a7 3, cl. 7. Impeachment is also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and Congress is not restricted to \nrelying only on impeachment, rather than making criminal law applicable to a former President, as OLC \nhas recognized. A Sitting President\u2019s Amenability to Indictment and Criminal Prosecution, 24 Op. O.L.C. \nat 255 (\u201cRecognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not preclude such \nprosecution once the President\u2019s term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by resignation or \nimpeachment.\u201d).    \n178 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nofficial power is being used for the purpose of protecting the President\u2019s personal interests. In \ncontrast, the President\u2019s actions to serve political or policy interests would not qualify as corrupt.  \nThe President\u2019s role as head of the government necessarily requires him to take into account \npolitical factors in making policy decisions that affect law-enforcement actions and proceedings.  \nFor instance, the President\u2019s decision to curtail a law-enforcement investigation to avoid \ninternational friction would not implicate the obstruction-of-justice statutes. The criminal law \ndoes not seek to regulate the consideration of such political or policy factors in the conduct of \ngovernment.   And when legitimate interests animate the President\u2019s conduct, those interests will \nalmost invariably be readily identifiable based on objective factors. Because the President\u2019s \nconduct in those instances will obviously fall outside the zone of obstruction law, no chilling \nconcern should arise. \nb.  There is also no reason to believe that investigations, let alone prosecutions, would \noccur except in highly unusual circumstances when a credible factual basis exists to believe that \nobstruction occurred. Prosecutorial action enjoys a presumption of regularity: absent \u201cclear \nevidence to the contrary, courts presume that [prosecutors] have properly discharged their official \nduties.\u201d Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 \nU.S. 1, 14\u201315 (1926)). The presumption of prosecutorial regularity would provide even greater \nprotection to the President than exists in routine cases given the prominence and sensitivity of any \nmatter involving the President and the likelihood that such matters will be subject to thorough and \ncareful review at the most senior levels of the Department of Justice. Under OLC\u2019s opinion that a \nsitting President is entitled to immunity from indictment, only a successor Administration would \nbe able to prosecute a former President. But that consideration does not suggest that a President \nwould have any basis for fearing abusive investigations or prosecutions after leaving office. There \nare \u201cobvious political checks\u201d against initiating a baseless investigation or prosecution of a former \nPresident. See Administrator of General Services, 433 U.S. at 448 (considering political checks \nin separation-of-powers analysis). And the Attorney General holds \u201cthe power to conduct the \ncriminal litigation of the United States Government,\u201d United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 694 \n(citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 516), which provides a strong institutional safeguard against politicized \ninvestigations or prosecutions. 1092 \n1092 Similar institutional safeguards protect Department of Justice officers and line prosecutors \nagainst unfounded investigations into prosecutorial acts. \nProsecutors are generally barred from \nparticipating in matters implicating their personal interests, see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 45.2, and are instructed not to \nbe influenced by their \u201cown professional or personal circumstances,\u201d Justice Manual \u00a7 9-27.260, so \nprosecutors would not frequently be in a position to take action that could be perceived as corrupt and \npersonally motivated. And if such cases arise, criminal investigation would be conducted by responsible \nofficials at the Department of Justice, who can be presumed to refrain from pursuing an investigation absent \na credible factual basis. Those facts distinguish the criminal context from the common-law rule of \nprosecutorial immunity, which protects against the threat of suit by \u201ca defendant [who] often will transform \nhis resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions.\u201d Imbler v. \nPachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 425 (1976). As the Supreme Court has noted, the existence of civil immunity \ndoes not justify criminal immunity. See O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (\u201cWhatever may be \nthe case with respect to civil liability generally, . . . we have never held that the performance of the duties \nof judicial, legislative, or executive officers, requires or contemplates the immunization of otherwise \ncriminal deprivation of constitutional rights.\u201d) (citations omitted). \n179 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nThese considerations distinguish the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Nixon v. Fitzgerald that, \nin part because inquiries into the President\u2019s motives would be \u201chighly intrusive,\u201d the President is \nabsolutely immune from private civil damages actions based on his official conduct. 457 U.S. at \n756-757. As Fitzgerald recognized, \u201cthere is a lesser public interest in actions for civil damages \nthan, for example, in criminal prosecutions.\u201d Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 754 n.37; see Cheney, 542 \nU.S. at 384.  And private actions are not subject to the institutional protections of an action under \nthe supervision of the Attorney General and subject to a presumption of regularity. Armstrong, \n517 U.S. at 464. \nc. In the rare  cases  in which a substantial and credible  basis  justifies conducting an \ninvestigation of the President, the process of examining his motivations to determine whether he \nacted for a corrupt purpose need not have a chilling effect. \nAscertaining the President\u2019s \nmotivations would turn on any explanation he provided to justify his actions, the advice he \nreceived, the circumstances surrounding the actions, and the regularity or irregularity of the \nprocess he employed to make decisions. But grand juries and courts would not have automatic \naccess to confidential presidential communications on those matters; rather, they could be \npresented in official proceedings only on a showing of sufficient need. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 712; In \nre Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 754, 756-757 (D.C. Cir. 1997); see also Administrator of General \nServices, 433 U.S. at 448-449 (former President can invoke presidential communications privilege, \nalthough successor\u2019s failure to support the claim \u201cdetracts from [its] weight\u201d). \nIn any event, probing the President\u2019s intent in a criminal matter is unquestionably \nconstitutional in at least one context: the offense of bribery turns on the corrupt intent to receive \na thing of value in return for being influenced in official action. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(b)(2). There can \nbe no serious argument against the President\u2019s potential criminal liability for bribery offenses, \nnotwithstanding the need to ascertain his purpose and intent. See U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 3; ART. II, \n\u00a7 4; see also Application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 458 to Presidential Appointments of Federal Judges, 19 \nOp. O.L.C. at 357 n.11 (\u201cApplication of \u00a7 201[to the President] raises no separation of powers \nissue, let alone a serious one.\u201d).     \nd. Finally, history provides no reason to believe that any asserted chilling effect justifies \nexempting the President from the obstruction laws. As a historical matter, Presidents have very \nseldom been the subjects of grand jury investigations. And it is rarer still for circumstances to \nraise even the possibility of a corrupt personal motive for arguably obstructive action through the \nPresident\u2019s use of official power. Accordingly, the President\u2019s conduct of office should not be \nchilled based on hypothetical concerns about the possible application of a corrupt-motive standard \nin this context. \n* \n* \n* \nIn sum, contrary to the position taken by the President\u2019s counsel, we concluded that, in \nlight of the Supreme Court precedent governing separation-of-powers issues, we had a valid basis \nfor investigating the conduct at issue in this report. In our view, the application of the obstruction \nstatutes would not impermissibly burden the President\u2019s performance of his Article II function to \nsupervise prosecutorial conduct or to remove inferior law-enforcement officers. \nAnd the \nprotection of the criminal justice system from corrupt acts by any person\u2014including the \nPresident\u2014accords with the fundamental principle of our government that \u201c[n]o [person] in this \n180 \n",

CONCLUSION \nBecause we determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, we did not draw \nultimate conclusions about the President\u2019s conduct. \nThe evidence we obtained about the \nPresident\u2019s actions and intent presents difficult issues that would need to be resolved if we were \nmaking a traditional prosecutorial judgment. At the same time, if we had confidence after a \nthorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, \nwe would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach \nthat judgment. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a \ncrime, it also does not exonerate him.   \n182 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nII. RUSSIAN \u201cACTIVE MEASURES\u201d SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN \nThe first form of Russian election influence came principally from the Internet Research \nAgency, LLC (IRA), a Russian organization funded by Yevgeniy Viktorovich Prigozhin and \ncompanies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting LLC and Concord \nCatering (collectively \u201cConcord\u201d).2  The IRA conducted social media operations targeted at large \nU.S. audiences with the goal of sowing discord in the U.S. political system.3 These operations \nconstituted \u201cactive measures\u201d (\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u044f), a term that typically refers to operations \nconducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs.4 \nThe IRA and its employees began operations targeting the United States as early as 2014.  \nUsing fictitious U.S. personas, IRA employees operated social media accounts and group pages \ndesigned to attract U.S. audiences. These groups and accounts, which addressed divisive U.S. \npolitical and social issues, falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists. Over time, these \nsocial media accounts became a means to reach large U.S. audiences. IRA employees travelled to \nthe United States in mid-2014 on an intelligence-gathering mission to obtain information and \nphotographs for use in their social media posts.  \nIRA employees posted derogatory information about a number of candidates in the 2016 \nU.S. presidential election. By early to mid-2016, IRA operations included supporting the Trump \nCampaign and disparaging candidate Hillary Clinton. The IRA made various expenditures to carry \nout those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. \npersons and entities. Some IRA employees, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their \nRussian association, communicated electronically with individuals associated with the Trump \nCampaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities, including the \nstaging of political rallies.5 The investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons \nknowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA\u2019s interference operation.  \nBy the end of the 2016 U.S. election, the IRA had the ability to reach millions of U.S. \npersons through their social media accounts. Multiple IRA-controlled Facebook groups and \n2 The Office is aware of reports that other Russian entities engaged in similar active measures \noperations targeting the United States. Some evidence collected by the Office corroborates those reports, \nand the Office has shared that evidence with other offices in the Department of Justice and FBI.   \n3 \nsee also  SM-2230634, serial 44 (analysis). The FBI case number cited here, and other FBI case numbers  \nidentified in the report, should be treated as law enforcement sensitive given the context. The report contains  \nadditional law enforcement sensitive information.  \nHarm to Ongoing Matter\n4  As discussed in Part V  below, the active measures investigation has resulted in criminal charges \nagainst 13 individual Russian nationals and three Russian entities, principally for  conspiracy  to defraud the \nUnited States, in violation  of  18 U.S.C. \u00a7  371.

U.S. Operations Through IRA-Controlled Social Media Accounts  \nDozens of IRA employees were responsible for operating accounts and personas on \ndifferent U.S. social media platforms. The IRA referred to employees assigned to operate the \nsocial media accounts as \u201cspecialists.\u201d42 Starting as early as 2014, the IRA\u2019s U.S. operations \nincluded social media specialists focusing on Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.43  The IRA later \nadded specialists who operated on Tumblr and Instagram accounts.44 \nInitially, the IRA created social media accounts that pretended to be the personal accounts \nof U.S. persons.45   By early 2015, the IRA began to create larger social media groups or public \nsocial media pages that claimed (falsely) to be affiliated with U.S. political and grassroots \norganizations. In certain cases, the IRA created accounts that mimicked real U.S. organizations.  \nFor example, one IRA-controlled Twitter account, @TEN_GOP, purported to be connected to the \nTennessee Republican Party.46 More commonly, the IRA created accounts in the names of \nfictitious U.S. organizations and grassroots groups and used these accounts to pose as anti-\nimmigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black Lives Matter protestors, and other U.S. social and \npolitical activists. \nThe IRA closely monitored the activity  of its  social media accounts.  \nHarm to Ongoing Matter\n40 \n41 \n42 \n43 \n. \nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\nHarm to Ongoing Matter\n \n \n44  See, e.g., SM-2230634,  serial 179 Harm to Ongoing Matter\n45 See, e.g., Facebook ID 100011390466802 (Alex Anderson); Facebook ID 100009626173204 \n(Andrea Hansen); Facebook ID 100009728618427 (Gary Williams); Facebook ID 100013640043337 \n(Lakisha Richardson). \n46 The account claimed to be the \u201cUnofficial Twitter of Tennessee Republicans\u201d and made posts \nthat appeared to be endorsements of the state political party.

For example, on May 31, 2016, the \noperational account \u201cMatt Skiber\u201d began to privately message dozens of pro-Trump Facebook \ngroups asking them to help plan a \u201cpro-Trump rally near Trump Tower.\u201d55 \nTo reach larger U.S. audiences, the IRA purchased advertisements from Facebook that \npromoted the IRA groups on the newsfeeds of U.S. audience members. According to Facebook, \nthe IRA purchased over 3,500 advertisements, and the expenditures totaled approximately \n$100,000.56 \nDuring the U.S. presidential campaign, many IRA-purchased advertisements explicitly \nsupported or opposed a presidential candidate or promoted U.S. rallies organized by the IRA \n(discussed below). As early as March 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements that overtly \nopposed the Clinton Campaign. For example, on March 18, 2016, the IRA purchased an \nadvertisement depicting candidate Clinton and a caption that read in part, \u201cIf one day God lets \nthis liar enter the White House as a president \u2013 that day would be a real national tragedy.\u201d57 \nSimilarly, on April 6, 2016, the IRA purchased advertisements for its account \u201cBlack Matters\u201d \ncalling for a \u201cflashmob\u201d of U.S. persons to \u201ctake a photo with #HillaryClintonForPrison2016 or \n#nohillary2016.\u201d58 \nIRA-purchased advertisements featuring Clinton were, with very few \nexceptions, negative.59 \nIRA-purchased advertisements referencing candidate Trump largely supported his \ncampaign. The first known IRA advertisement explicitly endorsing the Trump Campaign was \npurchased on April 19, 2016. The IRA bought an advertisement for its Instagram account \u201cTea \nParty News\u201d asking U.S. persons to help them \u201cmake a patriotic team of young Trump supporters\u201d \nby uploading photos with the hashtag \u201c#KIDS4TRUMP.\u201d60 In subsequent months, the IRA \npurchased dozens of advertisements supporting the Trump Campaign, predominantly through the \nFacebook groups \u201cBeing Patriotic,\u201d \u201cStop All Invaders,\u201d and \u201cSecured Borders.\u201d  \n55  5/31/16 Facebook Message, ID 100009922908461 (Matt Skiber) to ID \n5/31/16 Facebook Message, ID 100009922908461 (Matt Skiber) to ID \nPP\nPersonal Privacy\n56 Social Media Influence in the 2016 U.S. Election, Hearing Before the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence, 115th Cong. 13 (11/1/17) (testimony of Colin Stretch, General Counsel of Facebook). \n57 3/18/16 Facebook Advertisement ID 6045505152575. \n58 4/6/16 Facebook Advertisement ID 6043740225319. \n59 See SM-2230634, serial 213 (documenting politically-oriented advertisements from the larger \nset provided by Facebook).  \n60 4/19/16 Facebook Advertisement ID 6045151094235. \n25 \n",

U.S. Operations Involving Political Rallies \nThe IRA organized and promoted political rallies inside the United States while posing as \nU.S. grassroots activists. First, the IRA used one of its preexisting social media personas \n(Facebook groups and Twitter accounts, for example) to announce and promote the event. The \nIRA then sent a large number of direct messages to followers of its social media account asking \nthem to attend the event. From those who responded with interest in attending, the IRA then sought \na U.S. person to serve as the event\u2019s coordinator. In most cases, the IRA account operator would \ntell the U.S. person that they personally could not attend the event due to some preexisting conflict \nor because they were somewhere else in the United States.82 The IRA then further promoted the \nevent by contacting U.S. media about the event and directing them to speak with the coordinator.83 \nAfter the event, the IRA posted videos and photographs of the event to the IRA\u2019s social media \naccounts.84 \nThe Office identified dozens of U.S. rallies organized by the IRA. The earliest evidence of \na rally was a \u201cconfederate rally\u201d in November 2015.85   The IRA  continued to organize rallies even \nafter the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Interactions and Contacts with the Trump Campaign \nThe investigation identified two different forms of connections between the IRA and  \nmembers of the Trump Campaign. (The investigation identified no similar connections between \nthe IRA and the Clinton Campaign.)  First, on multiple occasions, members and surrogates of the \nTrump Campaign promoted\u2014typically by linking, retweeting, or similar methods of reposting\u2014 \npro-Trump or anti-Clinton content published by the IRA through IRA-controlled social media \naccounts. Additionally, in a few instances, IRA employees represented themselves as U.S. persons \nto communicate with members of the Trump Campaign in an effort to seek assistance and \ncoordination on IRA-organized political rallies inside the United States.    \na. Trump Campaign Promotion of IRA Political Materials   \nAmong the U.S. \u201cleaders of public opinion\u201d targeted by the IRA were various members \nand surrogates of the Trump Campaign. In total, Trump Campaign affiliates promoted dozens of \ntweets, posts, and other political content created by the IRA. \n-\nPosts from the IRA-controlled Twitter account @TEN_GOP were cited or retweeted by \nmultiple Trump Campaign officials and surrogates, including Donald J.

Contact with Trump Campaign Officials in Connection to Rallies \nStarting in June 2016, the IRA contacted different U.S. persons affiliated with the Trump \nCampaign in an effort to coordinate pro-Trump IRA-organized rallies inside the United States. In \nall cases, the IRA contacted the Campaign while claiming to be U.S. political activists working on \nbehalf of a conservative grassroots organization. The IRA\u2019s contacts included requests for signs \nand other materials to use at rallies,107 as well as requests to promote the rallies and help coordinate \nlogistics.108 While certain campaign volunteers agreed to provide the requested support (for \nexample, agreeing to set aside a number of signs), the investigation has not identified evidence \nthat any Trump Campaign official understood the requests were coming from foreign nationals.  \n* * * \nIn sum, the investigation established that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election \nthrough the \u201cactive measures\u201d social media campaign carried out by the IRA, an organization \nfunded by Prigozhin and companies that he controlled. As explained further in Volume I, Section \nV.A, infra, the Office concluded (and a grand jury has alleged) that Prigozhin, his companies, and \nIRA employees violated U.S. law through these operations, principally by undermining through \ndeceptive acts the work of federal agencies charged with regulating foreign influence in U.S. \nelections. \n106 Harm to Ongoing Matter\n107 See, e.g., 8/16/16 Email, joshmilton024@gmail.com to PP\n@donaldtrump.com (asking for \nPP\nTrump/Pence \nsigns \nfor \nPP\nFlorida \nrally); \n8/18/16 \nEmail, \njoshmilton024@gmail.com \nto \n@donaldtrump.com (asking for Trump/Pence signs for Florida rally); 8/12/16 Email, \njoshmilton024@gmail.com to \n@donaldtrump.com (asking for \u201ccontact phone numbers for Trump \nCampaign affiliates\u201d in various Florida cities and signs). \n108 8/15/16 Email, Personal Privacy\nto joshmilton024@gmail.com \nPersonal Privacy\n(asking to add to \nlocations to the \u201cFlorida Goes Trump,\u201d list); 8/16/16 Email, \nto \njoshmilton024@gmail.com (volunteering to send an email blast to followers). \n35 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nIV. RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT LINKS TO AND CONTACTS WITH THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN \nThe Office identified multiple contacts\u2014\u201clinks,\u201d in the words of the Appointment Order\u2014 \nbetween Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government. The \nOffice investigated whether those contacts constituted a third avenue of attempted Russian \ninterference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election. In particular, the investigation \nexamined whether these contacts involved or resulted in coordination or a conspiracy with the \nTrump Campaign and Russia, including with respect to Russia providing assistance to the \nCampaign in exchange for any sort of favorable treatment in the future. Based on the available \ninformation, the investigation did not establish such coordination.      \nThis Section describes the principal links between the Trump Campaign and individuals \nwith ties to the Russian government, including some contacts with Campaign officials or associates \nthat have been publicly reported to involve Russian contacts. Each subsection begins with an \noverview of the Russian contact at issue and then describes in detail the relevant facts, which are \ngenerally presented in chronological order, beginning with the early months of the Campaign and \nextending through the post-election, transition period.  \nA. Campaign Period (September 2015 \u2013 November 8, 2016) \nRussian-government-connected individuals and media entities began showing interest in \nTrump\u2019s campaign in the months after he announced his candidacy in June 2015.288  Because \nTrump\u2019s status as a public figure at the time was attributable in large part to his prior business and \nentertainment dealings, this Office investigated whether a business contact with Russia-linked \nindividuals and entities during the campaign period\u2014the Trump Tower Moscow project, see \nVolume I, Section IV.A.1, infra\u2014led to or involved coordination of election assistance.     \nOutreach from individuals with ties to Russia continued in the spring and summer of 2016, \nwhen Trump was moving toward\u2014and eventually becoming\u2014the Republican nominee for \nPresident. As set forth below, the Office also evaluated a series of links during this period: \noutreach to two of Trump\u2019s then-recently named foreign policy advisors, including a \nrepresentation that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton in the form of thousands of emails (Volume I, \nSections IV.A.2 & IV.A.3); dealings with a D.C.-based think tank that specializes in Russia and \nhas connections with its government (Volume I, Section IV.A.4); a meeting at Trump Tower \nbetween the Campaign and a Russian lawyer promising dirt on candidate Clinton that was \u201cpart of \nRussia and its government\u2019s support for [Trump]\u201d (Volume I, Section IV.A.5); events at the \nRepublican National Convention (Volume I, Section IV.A.6); post-Convention contacts between \nTrump Campaign officials and Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States (Volume I, Section \nIV.A.7); and contacts through campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had previously worked for \na Russian oligarch and a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine (Volume I, Section IV.A.8).    \n288 For example, on August 18, 2015, on behalf of the editor-in-chief of the internet newspaper \nVzglyad, Georgi Asatryan emailed campaign press secretary Hope Hicks asking for a phone or in-person \ncandidate interview. 8/18/15 Email, Asatryan to Hicks. One day earlier, the publication\u2019s founder (and \nformer Russian parliamentarian) Konstantin Rykov had registered two Russian websites\u2014Trump2016.ru \nand DonaldTrump2016.ru. No interview took place.   \n66 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n1. Trump Tower Moscow Project \nThe Trump Organization has pursued and completed projects outside the United States as \npart of its real estate portfolio. Some projects have involved the acquisition and ownership \n(through subsidiary corporate structures) of property.  In other cases, the Trump Organization has \nexecuted licensing deals with real estate developers and management companies, often local to the \ncountry where the project was located.289 \nBetween at least 2013 and 2016, the Trump Organization explored a similar licensing deal \nin Russia involving the construction of a Trump-branded property in Moscow. The project, \ncommonly referred to as a \u201cTrump Tower Moscow\u201d or \u201cTrump Moscow\u201d project, anticipated a \ncombination of commercial, hotel, and residential properties all within the same building. \nBetween 2013 and June 2016, several employees of the Trump Organization, including then-\npresident of the organization Donald J. Trump, pursued a Moscow deal with several Russian \ncounterparties. From the fall of 2015 until the middle of 2016, Michael Cohen spearheaded the \nTrump Organization\u2019s pursuit of a Trump Tower Moscow project, including by reporting on the \nproject\u2019s status to candidate Trump and other executives in the Trump Organization.290 \na. Trump Tower Moscow Venture with the Crocus Group (2013-2014) \n The Trump Organization and the Crocus Group, a Russian real estate conglomerate owned \nand controlled by Aras Agalarov, began discussing a Russia-based real estate project shortly after \nthe conclusion of the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.291 Donald J. Trump Jr. served as \nthe primary negotiator on behalf of the Trump Organization; Emin Agalarov (son of Aras \nAgalarov) and Irakli \u201cIke\u201d Kaveladze represented the Crocus Group during negotiations,292 with \nthe occasional assistance of Robert Goldstone.293 \nIn December 2013, Kaveladze and Trump Jr. negotiated and signed preliminary terms of \n289 See, e.g., Interview of: Donald J. Trump, Jr, Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 151-52 \n(Sept. 7, 2017) (discussing licensing deals of specific projects).   \n290 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D.1, supra, in November 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to \nmaking false statements to Congress concerning, among other things, the duration of the Trump Tower \nMoscow project. See Information \u00b6 7(a), United States v. Michael Cohen, 1:18-cr-850 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 29, \n2018), Doc. 2 (\u201cCohen Information\u201d).      \n291 See Interview of: Donald J. Trump, Jr, Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 13 (Sept. 7, \n2017) (\u201cFollowing the pageant the Trump Organization and Mr. Agalarov\u2019s company, Crocus Group, began \npreliminarily discussion [sic] potential real estate projects in Moscow.\u201d). As has been widely reported, the \nMiss Universe pageant\u2014which Trump co-owned at the time\u2014was held at the Agalarov-owned Crocus \nCity Hall in Moscow in November 2013. Both groups were involved in organizing the pageant, and Aras \nAgalarov\u2019s son Emin was a musical performer at the event, which Trump attended. \n292  Kaveladze 11/16/17 302, at 2, 4-6; Grand Jury\n \nOSC-\nKAV_00385 (12/6/13 Email, Trump Jr. to Kaveladze & E.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nan agreement for the Trump Tower Moscow project.294  On December 23, 2013, after discussions \nwith Donald J. Trump, the Trump Organization agreed to accept an arrangement whereby the \norganization received a flat 3.5% commission on all sales, with no licensing fees or incentives.295 \nThe parties negotiated a letter of intent during January and February 2014.296 \nFrom January 2014 through November 2014, the Trump Organization and Crocus Group \ndiscussed development plans for the Moscow project. Some time before January 24, 2014, the \nCrocus Group sent the Trump Organization a proposal for a 800-unit, 194-meter building to be \nconstructed at an Agalarov-owned site in Moscow called \u201cCrocus City,\u201d which had also been the \nsite of the Miss Universe pageant.297 In February 2014, Ivanka Trump met with Emin Agalarov \nand toured the Crocus City site during a visit to Moscow.298 From March 2014 through July 2014, \nthe groups discussed \u201cdesign standards\u201d and other architectural elements.299  For example, in July \n2014, members of the Trump Organization sent Crocus Group counterparties questions about the \n\u201cdemographics of these prospective buyers\u201d in the Crocus City area, the development of \nneighboring parcels in Crocus City, and concepts for redesigning portions of the building.300  In \nAugust 2014, the Trump Organization requested specifications for a competing Marriott-branded \ntower being built in Crocus City.301 \nBeginning in September 2014, the Trump Organization stopped responding in a timely \nfashion to correspondence and proposals from the Crocus Group.302  Communications between the \ntwo groups continued through November 2014 with decreasing frequency; what appears to be the \nlast communication is dated November 24, 2014.303 The project appears not to have developed \npast the planning stage, and no construction occurred.   \n294 Grand Jury\n295 OSC-KAV_00452 (12/23/13 Email, Trump Jr. to Kaveladze & E.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nb. Communications with I.C. Expert Investment Company and Giorgi \nRtskhiladze (Summer and Fall 2015) \nIn the late summer of 2015, the Trump Organization received a new inquiry about pursuing \na Trump Tower project in Moscow.  In approximately September 2015, Felix Sater, a New York-\nbased real estate advisor, contacted Michael Cohen, then-executive vice president of the Trump \nOrganization and special counsel to Donald J. Trump.304  Sater had previously worked with the \nTrump Organization and advised it on a number of domestic and international projects.  Sater had \nexplored the possibility of a Trump Tower project in Moscow while working with the Trump \nOrganization and therefore knew of the organization\u2019s general interest in completing a deal \nthere.305  Sater had also  served as  an informal  agent  of the Trump Organization in Moscow \npreviously and had accompanied Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to Moscow in the mid-\n2000s.306 \nSater contacted Cohen on behalf of I.C. Expert Investment Company (I.C. Expert), a \nRussian real-estate development corporation controlled by Andrei Vladimirovich Rozov.307  Sater \nhad known Rozov since approximately 2007 and, in 2014, had served as an agent on behalf of \nRozov during Rozov\u2019s purchase of a building in New York City.308 Sater later contacted Rozov \nand proposed that I.C. Expert pursue a Trump Tower Moscow project in which I.C. Expert would \nlicense the name and brand from the Trump Organization but construct the building on its own. \nSater worked on the deal with Rozov and another employee of I.C. Expert.309 \nCohen was the only Trump Organization representative to negotiate directly with I.C. \nExpert or its agents. In approximately September 2015, Cohen obtained approval to negotiate with \nI.C. Expert from candidate Trump, who was then president of the Trump Organization.  Cohen \nprovided updates directly to Trump about the project throughout 2015 and into 2016, assuring him \nthe project was continuing.310 Cohen also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka \nTrump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project311) and Donald J. \nTrump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project312) during the \nfall of 2015. \n304  Sater provided information to our Office in two 2017 interviews conducted under a proffer  \nagreement, Grand Jury\n \n \n305 Grand Jury\n306 Sater 9/19/17 302, at 1-2, 5. \n307 Sater 9/19/17 302, at 3. \n308 Rozov 1/25/18 302, at 1. \n309 Rozov 1/25/18 302, at 1; see also 11/2/15 Email, Cohen to Rozov et al.

Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or \nanyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump \nMoscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the \ncandidate suggested that his campaign would be a significant \u201cinfomercial\u201d for Trump-branded \nproperties.329 \nii. Post-LOI Contacts with Individuals in Russia \nGiven the size of the Trump Moscow project, Sater and Cohen believed the project required \napproval (whether express or implicit) from the Russian national government, including from the \nPresidential Administration of Russia.330 Sater stated that he therefore began to contact the \nPresidential Administration through another Russian business contact.331 In early negotiations \nwith the Trump Organization, Sater had alluded to the need for government approval and his \nattempts to set up meetings with Russian officials.  On October 12, 2015, for example, Sater wrote \nto Cohen that \u201call we need is Putin on board and we are golden,\u201d \nGrand Jury\nand that a \u201cmeeting with Putin \nand top deputy is tentatively set for the 14th [of October].\u201d332 \nthis meeting \nwas being coordinated by associates in Russia and that he had no direct interaction with the Russian \ngovernment.333 \nApproximately a month later, after the LOI had been signed, Lana Erchova emailed Ivanka \nTrump on behalf of Erchova\u2019s then-husband Dmitry Klokov, to offer Klokov\u2019s assistance to the \nTrump Campaign.334 Klokov was at that time Director of External Communications for PJSC \nFederal Grid Company of Unified Energy System, a large Russian electricity transmission \n328 11/3/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:40 p.m.). \n329 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 3-4; Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 15. \n330Grand Jury\n Sater 12/15/17 302, at 2. \n331 Sater 12/15/17 302, at 3-4. \n332 10/12/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (8:07 a.m.).   \n333 Grand Jury\n334 Ivanka Trump received an email from a woman who identified herself as \u201cLana E.

Ivanka Trump forwarded the email to Cohen.335  He told the Office that, after receiving \nthis inquiry, he had conducted an internet search for Klokov\u2019s name and concluded (incorrectly) \nthat Klokov was a former Olympic weightlifter.336 \nBetween November 18 and 19, 2015, Klokov and Cohen had at least one telephone call \nand exchanged several emails. Describing himself in emails to Cohen as a \u201ctrusted person\u201d who \ncould offer the Campaign \u201cpolitical synergy\u201d and \u201csynergy on a government level,\u201d Klokov \nrecommended that Cohen travel to Russia to speak with him and an unidentified intermediary. \nKlokov said that those conversations could facilitate a later meeting in Russia between the \ncandidate and an individual Klokov described as \u201cour person of interest.\u201d337  In an email to the \nOffice, Erchova later identified the \u201cperson of interest\u201d as Russian President Vladimir Putin.338 \nIn the telephone call and follow-on emails with Klokov, Cohen discussed his desire to use \na near-term trip to Russia to do site surveys and talk over the Trump Moscow project with local \ndevelopers. Cohen registered his willingness also to meet with Klokov and the unidentified \nintermediary, but was emphatic that all meetings in Russia involving him or candidate Trump\u2014 \nincluding a possible meeting between candidate Trump and Putin\u2014would need to be \u201cin \nconjunction with the development and an official visit\u201d with the Trump Organization receiving a \nformal invitation to visit.339 (Klokov had written previously that \u201cthe visit [by candidate Trump \nto Russia] has to be informal.\u201d)340 \nKlokov had also previously recommended to Cohen that he separate their negotiations over \na possible meeting between Trump and \u201cthe person of interest\u201d from any existing business track.341 \nRe-emphasizing that his outreach was not done on behalf of any business, Klokov added in second \nemail to Cohen that, if publicized well, such a meeting could have \u201cphenomenal\u201d impact \u201cin a \nbusiness dimension\u201d and that the \u201cperson of interest[\u2019s]\u201d \u201cmost important support\u201d could have \nsignificant ramifications for the \u201clevel of projects and their capacity.\u201d Klokov concluded by telling \n335 11/16/15 Email, I. Trump to Cohen. \n336 Cohen 8/7/18 302, at 17. During his interviews with the Office, Cohen still appeared to believe \nthat the Klokov he spoke with was that Olympian. The investigation, however, established that the email \naddress used to communicate with Cohen belongs to a different Dmitry Klokov, as described above. \n337 11/18/15 Email, Klokov to Cohen (6:51 a.m.).  \n338 In July 2018, the Office received an unsolicited email purporting to be from Erchova, in which \nshe wrote that \u201c[a]t the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016 I was asked by my ex-husband to contact Ivanka \nTrump . . . and offer cooperation to Trump\u2019s team on behalf of the Russian officials.\u201d 7/27/18 Email, \nErchova to Special Counsel\u2019s Office. The email claimed that the officials wanted to offer candidate Trump \n\u201cland in Crimea among other things and unofficial meeting with Putin.\u201d Id. In order to vet the email\u2019s \nclaims, the Office responded requesting more details.  The Office did not receive any reply. \n339 11/18/15 Email, Cohen to Klokov (7:15 a.m.).   \n340 11/18/15 Email, Klokov to Cohen (6:51 a.m.). \n341 11/18/15 Email, Klokov to Cohen (6:51 a.m.) (\u201cI would suggest separating your negotiations \nand our proposal to meet.

Cohen explained that he \ndid not pursue the proposed meeting because he was already working on the Moscow Project with \nSater, who Cohen understood to have his own connections to the Russian government.344 \nBy late December 2015, however, Cohen was complaining that Sater had not been able to \nuse those connections to set up the promised meeting with Russian government officials. Cohen \ntold Sater that he was \u201csetting up the meeting myself.\u201d345 On January 11, 2016, Cohen emailed \nthe office of Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government\u2019s press secretary, indicating that he desired \ncontact with Sergei Ivanov, Putin\u2019s chief of staff. Cohen erroneously used the email address \n\u201cPr_peskova@prpress.gof.ru\u201d instead of \u201cPr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru,\u201d so the email apparently \ndid not go through.346 On January 14, 2016, Cohen emailed a different address \n(info@prpress.gov.ru) with the following message:  \nDear Mr. Peskov, \nOver the past few months, I have been working with a company based in Russia regarding \nthe development of a Trump Tower-Moscow project in Moscow City. \nWithout getting into lengthy specifics, the communication between our two sides has  \nstalled. As this project is too important, I am hereby requesting your assistance. \nI respectfully request someone, preferably you; contact me so that I might discuss the \nspecifics as well as arranging meetings with the appropriate individuals. \nI thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.347 \nTwo days later, Cohen sent an email to Pr_peskova@prpress.gov.ru, repeating his request to speak \nwith Sergei Ivanov.348 \nCohen testified to Congress, and initially told the Office, that he did not recall receiving a \nresponse to this email inquiry and that he decided to terminate any further work on the Trump \nMoscow project as of January 2016.

Sater\u2019s Overtures to Cohen to Travel to Russia \nThe late January communication was neither the first nor the last time that Cohen \ncontemplated visiting Russia in pursuit of the Trump Moscow project. Beginning in late 2015, \nSater repeatedly tried to arrange for Cohen and candidate Trump, as representatives of the Trump \nOrganization, to travel to Russia to meet with Russian government officials and possible financing \npartners. In December 2015, Sater sent Cohen a number of emails about logistics for traveling to \nRussia for meetings.358  On December 19, 2015, Sater wrote: \nPlease call me I have Evgeney [Dvoskin] on the other line.[359] He needs a copy of your \nand Donald\u2019s passports they need a scan of every page of the passports.  Invitations & \nVisas will be issued this week by VTB Bank to discuss financing for Trump Tower  \nMoscow. Politically neither Putins office nor Ministry of Foreign Affairs cannot issue \ninvite, so they are inviting commercially/ business. VTB is Russia\u2019s 2 biggest bank and \nVTB Bank CEO Andrey Kostin, will be at all meetings with Putin so that it is a business \nmeeting not political. We will be invited to Russian consulate this week to receive invite \n& have visa issued.360 \nIn response, Cohen texted Sater an image of his own passport.361  Cohen told the Office that at one \npoint he requested a copy of candidate Trump\u2019s passport from Rhona Graff, Trump\u2019s executive \nassistant at the Trump Organization, and that Graff later brought Trump\u2019s passport to Cohen\u2019s \n357 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-7. \n358 See, e.g., 12/1/15 Email, Sater to Cohen (12:41 p.m.) (\u201cPlease scan and send me a copy of your \npassport for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u201d).\n359  Toll records show that Sater was speaking to  Evgeny  Dvoskin.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nOn June 9, 2016, Sater sent Cohen a notice that he (Sater) was completing the badges for \nthe Forum, adding, \u201cPutin is there on the 17th very strong chance you will meet him as well.\u201d370 \nOn June 13, 2016, Sater forwarded Cohen an invitation to the Forum signed by the Director of the \nRoscongress Foundation, the Russian entity organizing the Forum.371 Sater also sent Cohen a \nRussian visa application and asked him to send two passport photos.372 According to Cohen, the \ninvitation gave no indication that Peskov had been involved in inviting him. Cohen was concerned \nthat Russian officials were not actually involved or were not interested in meeting with him (as \nSater had alleged), and so he decided not to go to the Forum.373 On June 14, 2016, Cohen met \nSater in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York and informed him that he would not be \ntraveling at that time.374 \nii. Candidate Trump\u2019s Opportunities to Travel to Russia \nThe investigation identified evidence that, during the period the Trump Moscow project \nwas under consideration, the possibility of candidate Trump visiting Russia arose in two contexts.   \nFirst, in interviews with the Office, Cohen stated that he discussed the subject of traveling \nto Russia with Trump twice: once in late 2015; and again in spring 2016.375 According to Cohen, \nTrump indicated a willingness to travel if it would assist the project significantly. On one occasion, \nTrump told Cohen to speak with then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to coordinate the \ncandidate\u2019s schedule. Cohen recalled that he spoke with Lewandowski, who suggested that they \nspeak again when Cohen had actual dates to evaluate. Cohen indicated, however, that he knew \nthat travel prior to the Republican National Convention would be impossible given the candidate\u2019s \npreexisting commitments to the Campaign.376 \nSecond, like Cohen, Trump received and turned down an invitation to the St. Petersburg \nInternational Economic Forum. In late December 2015, Mira Duma\u2014a contact of Ivanka Trump\u2019s \nfrom the fashion industry\u2014first passed along invitations for Ivanka Trump and candidate Trump \nfrom Sergei Prikhodko, a Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.377 On January 14, \n2016, Rhona Graff sent an email to Duma stating that Trump was \u201chonored to be asked to \nparticipate in the highly prestigious\u201d Forum event, but that he would \u201chave to decline\u201d the \ninvitation given his \u201cvery grueling and full travel schedule\u201d as a presidential candidate.378   Graff \n370 FS00018 (6/9/16 Text Messages, Sater & Cohen). \n371 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen (2:10 p.m.). \n372 FS00018 (6/13/16 Text Message, Sater to Cohen (2:20 p.m.)); 6/13/16 Email, Sater to Cohen. \n373 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 6-8. \n374 FS00019 (6/14/16 Text Messages, Cohen & Sater (12:06 and 2:50 p.m.)). \n375 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 2. \n376 Cohen 9/12/18 302, at 7. \n377 12/21/15 Email, Mira to Ivanka Trump (6:57 a.m.) (attachments); TRUMPORG_16_000057 \n(1/7/16 Email, I.

According to Foresman, he had been asked by Anton Kobyakov, a Russian \npresidential aide involved with the Roscongress Foundation, to see if Trump could speak at the \nForum.385 Foresman first emailed Graff on March 31, 2016, following a phone introduction \nbrokered through Trump business associate Mark Burnett (who produced the television show The \nApprentice). In his email, Foresman referenced his long-standing personal and professional \nexpertise in Russia and Ukraine, his work setting up an early \u201cprivate channel\u201d between Vladimir \nPutin and former U.S. President George W. Bush, and an \u201capproach\u201d he had received from \u201csenior \nKremlin officials\u201d about the candidate. Foresman asked Graff for a meeting with the candidate, \nCorey Lewandowski, or \u201canother relevant person\u201d to discuss this and other \u201cconcrete things\u201d \nForesman felt uncomfortable discussing over \u201cunsecure email.\u201d386 On April 4, 2016, Graff \nforwarded Foresman\u2019s meeting request to Jessica Macchia, another executive assistant \nto Trump.387 \n379 1/15/16 Email, Mira to Graff. \n380 As explained in Volume II and Appendix C, on September 17, 2018, the Office sent written \nquestions to the President\u2019s counsel. On November 20, 2018, the President provided written answers to \nthose questions through counsel.  \n381 Written Responses of Donald J. Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 17 (Response to Question IV, \nPart (e)) (\u201c[D]ocuments show that Ms. Graff prepared for my signature a brief response declining the \ninvitation.\u201d). \n382 Written Responses of Donald J.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nWith no response forthcoming, Foresman twice sent reminders to Graff\u2014first on April 26 \nand again on April 30, 2016.388 Graff sent an apology to Foresman and forwarded his April 26 \nemail (as well as his initial March 2016 email) to Lewandowski.389 On May 2, 2016, Graff \nforwarded Foresman\u2019s April 30 email\u2014which suggested an alternative meeting with Donald \nTrump Jr. or Eric Trump so that Foresman could convey to them information that \u201cshould be \nconveyed to [the candidate] personally or [to] someone [the candidate] absolutely trusts\u201d\u2014to \npolicy advisor Stephen Miller.390 \nNo communications or other evidence obtained by the Office indicate that the Trump \nCampaign learned that Foresman was reaching out to invite the candidate to the Forum or that the \nCampaign otherwise followed up with Foresman until after the election, when he interacted with \nthe Transition Team as he pursued a possible position in the incoming Administration.391 When \ninterviewed by the Office, Foresman denied that the specific \u201capproach\u201d from \u201csenior Kremlin \nofficials\u201d noted in his March 31, 2016 email was anything other than Kobyakov\u2019s invitation to \nRoscongress. According to Foresman, the \u201cconcrete things\u201d he referenced in the same email were \na combination of the invitation itself, Foresman\u2019s personal perspectives on the invitation and \nRussia policy in general, and details of a Ukraine plan supported by a U.S. think tank (EastWest \nInstitute). Foresman told the Office that Kobyakov had extended similar invitations through him \nto another Republican presidential candidate and one other politician. Foresman also said that \nKobyakov had asked Foresman to invite Trump to speak after that other presidential candidate \nwithdrew from the race and the other politician\u2019s participation did not work out.392 Finally, \nForesman claimed to have no plans to establish a back channel involving Trump, stating the \nreference to his involvement in the Bush-Putin back channel was meant to burnish his credentials \nto the Campaign.  Foresman commented that he had not recognized any of the experts announced \nas Trump\u2019s foreign policy team in March 2016, and wanted to secure an in-person meeting with \nthe candidate to share his professional background and policy views, including that Trump should \ndecline Kobyakov\u2019s invitation to speak at the Forum.393 \n2.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\n2016 to early October 2016.394 In late April 2016, Papadopoulos was told by London-based \nprofessor Joseph Mifsud, immediately after Mifsud\u2019s return from a trip to Moscow, that the  \nRussian government had obtained \u201cdirt\u201d on candidate Clinton in the form of thousands of emails.  \nOne week later, on May 6, 2016, Papadopoulos suggested to a representative of a foreign \ngovernment that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that \nit could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information that would be \ndamaging to candidate Clinton.  \nPapadopoulos shared information about Russian \u201cdirt\u201d with people outside of the \nCampaign, and the Office investigated whether he also provided it to a Campaign official. \nPapadopoulos and the Campaign officials with whom he interacted told the Office that they did \nnot recall that Papadopoulos passed them the information. Throughout the relevant period of time \nand for several months thereafter, Papadopoulos worked with Mifsud and two Russian nationals \nto arrange a meeting between the Campaign and the Russian government. That meeting never \ncame to pass.          \na. Origins of Campaign Work \nIn March 2016, Papadopoulos became a foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.395 \nAs early as the summer of 2015, he had sought a role as a policy advisor to the Campaign but, in \na September 30, 2015 email, he was told that the Campaign was not hiring policy advisors.396  In \nlate 2015, Papadopoulos obtained a paid position on the campaign of Republican presidential \ncandidate Ben Carson.397 \nAlthough Carson remained in the presidential race until early March 2016, Papadopoulos \nhad stopped actively working for his campaign by early February 2016.398 \nAt that time, \nPapadopoulos reached out to a contact at the London Centre of International Law Practice \n(LCILP), which billed itself as a \u201cunique institution . . . comprising high-level professional \ninternational law practitioners, dedicated to the advancement of global legal knowledge and the \npractice of international law.\u201d399 Papadopoulos said that he had finished his role with the Carson \n394 Papadopoulos met with our Office for debriefings on several occasions in the summer and fall \nof 2017, after he was arrested and charged in a sealed criminal complaint with making false statements in \na January 2017 FBI interview about, inter alia, the timing, extent, and nature of his interactions and \ncommunications with Joseph Mifsud and two Russian nationals: Olga Polonskaya and Ivan Timofeev.  \nPapadopoulos later pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to an information charging him with \nmaking false statements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a).  \n395 A Transcript of Donald Trump\u2019s Meeting with the Washington Post Editorial Board, \nWashington Post (Mar. 21, 2016). \n396 7/15/15 LinkedIn Message, Papadopoulos to Lewandowski (6:57 a.m.); 9/30/15 Email, Glassner \nto Papadopoulos (7:42:21 a.m.).  \n397 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2. \n398 Papadopoulos 8/10/17 302, at 2; 2/4/16 Email, Papadopoulos to Idris. \n399 London Centre of International Law Practice, at https://www.lcilp.org/ (via web.archive.org). \n81 \n",

P. 6(e)\nOn March 17, 2016, Papadopoulos returned to London.420  Four days later, candidate  \nTrump publicly named him as a member of the foreign policy and national security advisory team \nchaired by Senator Jeff Sessions, describing Papadopoulos as \u201can oil and energy consultant\u201d and \nan \u201c[e]xcellent guy.\u201d421 \nOn March 24, 2016, Papadopoulos met with Mifsud in London.422  Mifsud was  \naccompanied by a Russian female named Olga Polonskaya. Mifsud introduced Polonskaya as a \nformer student of his who had connections to Vladimir Putin.423 Papadopoulos understood at the \ntime that Polonskaya may have been Putin\u2019s niece but later learned that this was not true.424 During \nthe meeting, Polonskaya offered to help Papadopoulos establish contacts in Russia and stated that \nthe Russian ambassador in London was a friend of hers.425 Based on this interaction, Papadopoulos \nexpected Mifsud and Polonskaya to introduce him to the Russian ambassador in London, but that \ndid not occur.426 \nFollowing his meeting with Mifsud, Papadopoulos sent an email to members of the Trump \nCampaign\u2019s foreign policy advisory team. The subject line of the message was \u201cMeeting with \nRussian leadership--including Putin.\u201d427  The message stated in pertinent part:  \nI just finished a very productive lunch with a good friend of mine, Joseph Mifsud, the \ndirector of the London Academy of Diplomacy--who introduced me to both Putin\u2019s niece \nand the Russian Ambassador in London--who also acts as the Deputy Foreign Minister.428 \nThe topic of the lunch was to arrange a meeting between us and the Russian leadership to \ndiscuss U.S.-Russia ties under President Trump. They are keen to host us in a \u201cneutral\u201d \ncity, or directly in Moscow. They said the leadership, including Putin, is ready to meet with \nus and Mr. Trump should there be interest.

Such \ndisclosures raised questions about whether Papadopoulos informed any Trump Campaign official \nabout the emails.    \nWhen interviewed, Papadopoulos and the Campaign officials who interacted with him told \nthe Office that they could not recall Papadopoulos\u2019s sharing the information that Russia had \nobtained \u201cdirt\u201d on candidate Clinton in the form of emails or that Russia could assist the Campaign \nthrough the anonymous release of information about Clinton. Papadopoulos stated that he could \nnot clearly recall having told anyone on the Campaign and wavered about whether he accurately \nremembered an incident in which Clovis had been upset after hearing Papadopoulos tell Clovis \nthat Papadopoulos thought \u201cthey have her emails.\u201d495 The Campaign officials who interacted or \ncorresponded with Papadopoulos have similarly stated, with varying degrees of certainty, that he \ndid not tell them. Senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, for example, did not remember hearing \nanything from Papadopoulos or Clovis about Russia having emails of or dirt on candidate \nClinton.496   Clovis stated that he did not recall anyone, including Papadopoulos, having given him  \nnon-public information that a foreign government might be in possession of material damaging to  \nHillary Clinton.497  \n98 \nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\n492 George Papadopoulos: Sanctions Have Done Little More Than to Turn Russia Towards China, \nInterfax (Sept. 30, 2016). \n493 Papadopoulos 9/19/17 302, at 14-15; Def.

Gordon, and Walid Phares and suggested that \ncandidate Trump take his place speaking at the commencement ceremony in Moscow.557  On June \n19, 2016, Page followed up again to request approval to speak at the NES event and to reiterate \nthat NES \u201cwould love to have Mr. Trump speak at this annual celebration\u201d in Page\u2019s place.558 \nCampaign manager Corey Lewandowski responded the same day, saying, \u201cIf you want to do this, \nit would be out side [sic] of your role with the DJT for President campaign. I am certain Mr. \nTrump will not be able to attend.\u201d559 \nIn early July 2016, Page traveled to Russia for the NES events. On July 5, 2016, Denis \nKlimentov, copying his brother, Dmitri Klimentov,560 emailed Maria Zakharova, the Director of \nthe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 Information and Press Department, about Page\u2019s visit and \nhis connection to the Trump Campaign.561 Denis Klimentov said in the email that he wanted to \ndraw the Russian government\u2019s attention to Page\u2019s visit in Moscow.562 His message to Zakharova \n550 Page 3/16/17 302, at 2-3; Page 3/10/17 302, at 3. \n551 S.

That interaction and a discussion of the December trip are set forth \nin Volume I, Section IV.B.6, infra. \n4. Dimitri Simes and the Center for the National Interest \nMembers of the Trump Campaign interacted on several occasions with the Center for the \nNational Interest (CNI), principally through its President and Chief Executive Officer, Dimitri \nSimes. CNI is a think tank with expertise in and connections to the Russian government. Simes \nwas born in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to the United States in the 1970s. In April \n2016, candidate Trump delivered his first speech on foreign policy and national security at an event \nhosted by the National Interest, a publication affiliated with CNI. Then-Senator Jeff Sessions and \nRussian Ambassador Kislyak both attended the event and, as a result, it gained some attention in \nrelation to Sessions\u2019s confirmation hearings to become Attorney General. Sessions had various \nother contacts with CNI during the campaign period on foreign-policy matters, including Russia. \nJared Kushner also interacted with Simes about Russian issues during the campaign. The \ninvestigation did not identify evidence that the Campaign passed or received any messages to or \nfrom the Russian government through CNI or Simes.    \na. CNI and Dimitri Simes Connect with the Trump Campaign  \nCNI is a Washington-based non-profit organization that grew out of a center founded by \nformer President Richard Nixon.593  CNI describes itself \u201cas a voice for strategic realism in U.S. \nforeign policy,\u201d and publishes a bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, the National Interest.594  CNI \nis overseen by a board of directors and an advisory council that is largely honorary and whose \nmembers at the relevant time included Sessions, who served as an advisor to candidate Trump on \nnational security and foreign policy issues.595 \nDimitri Simes is president and CEO of CNI and the publisher and CEO of the National \nInterest.596 Simes was born in the former Soviet Union, emigrated to the United States in the early \n1970s, and joined CNI\u2019s predecessor after working at the Carnegie Endowment for International \n592 \n,  \u201cTransition Online Form,\u201d 11/14/16  \nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\n593 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 1-2. \n594 About the Center, CNI, available at https://cftni.org/about/. \n595 \nAdvisory Counsel, CNI, available at https://web.archive.org/web/20161030025331/ \nhttp://cftni.org/about/advisory-council/; Simes 3/8/18 302, at 3-4; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 4; Sessions \n1/17/18 302, at 16. \n596 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 2. \n103 \n",

As CNI stated when seeking a grant from the Carnegie \nCorporation in 2015, CNI has \u201cunparalleled access to Russian officials and politicians among \nWashington think tanks,\u201d599 in part because CNI has arranged for U.S. delegations to visit Russia \nand for Russian delegations to visit the United States as part of so-called \u201cTrack II\u201d diplomatic \nefforts.600 \nOn March 14, 2016, CNI board member Richard Plepler organized a luncheon for CNI and \nits honorary chairman, Henry Kissinger, at the Time Warner Building in New York.601 The idea \nbehind the event was to generate interest in CNI\u2019s work and recruit new board members for CNI.602 \nAlong with Simes, attendees at the event included Jared Kushner, son-in-law of candidate \nTrump.603 Kushner told the Office that the event came at a time when the Trump Campaign was \nhaving trouble securing support from experienced foreign policy professionals and that, as a result, \nhe decided to seek Simes\u2019s assistance during the March 14 event.604 \nSimes and Kushner spoke again on a March 24, 2016 telephone call,605 three days after \nTrump had publicly named the team of foreign policy advisors that had been put together on short \nnotice.606 On March 31, 2016, Simes and Kushner had an in-person, one-on-one meeting in \nKushner\u2019s New York office.607 During that meeting, Simes told Kushner that the best way to \nhandle foreign-policy issues for the Trump Campaign would be to organize an advisory group of \nexperts to meet with candidate Trump and develop a foreign policy approach that was consistent \nwith Trump\u2019s voice.608  Simes believed that Kushner was receptive to that suggestion.609 \nSimes also had contact with other individuals associated with the Trump Campaign \nregarding the Campaign\u2019s foreign policy positions. For example, on June 17, 2016, Simes sent \nJ.D.

National Interest Hosts a Foreign Policy Speech at the Mayflower Hotel \nDuring both their March 24 phone call and their March 31 in-person meeting, Simes and \nKushner discussed the possibility of CNI hosting a foreign policy speech by candidate Trump.611 \nFollowing those conversations, Simes agreed that he and others associated with CNI would \nprovide behind-the-scenes input on the substance of the foreign-policy speech and that CNI \nofficials would coordinate the logistics of the speech with Sessions and his staff, including \nSessions\u2019s chief of staff, Rick Dearborn.612 \nIn mid-April 2016, Kushner put Simes in contact with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller \nand forwarded to Simes an outline of the foreign-policy speech that Miller had prepared.613  Simes \nsent back to the Campaign bullet points with ideas for the speech that he had drafted with CNI \nExecutive Director Paul Saunders and board member Richard Burt.614 Simes received subsequent \ndraft outlines from Miller, and he and Saunders spoke to Miller by phone about substantive \nchanges to the speech.615 It is not clear, however, whether CNI officials received an actual draft \nof the speech for comment; while Saunders recalled having received an actual draft, Simes did not, \nand the emails that CNI produced to this Office do not contain such a draft.616 \nAfter board members expressed concern to Simes that CNI\u2019s hosting the speech could be \nperceived as an endorsement of a particular candidate, CNI decided to have its publication, the \nNational Interest, serve as the host and to have the event at the National Press Club.617 Kushner \nlater requested that the event be moved to the Mayflower Hotel, which was another venue that \nSimes had mentioned during initial discussions with the Campaign, in order to address concerns \nabout security and capacity.618 \n610 C00008187 (6/17/16 Email, Simes to Gordon (3:35:45 p.m.)). \n611 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 7. \n612 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 8-11; C00008923 (4/6/16 Email, Simes to Burt (2:22:28 p.m.)); Burt 2/9/18 \n302, at 7. \n613 C00008551 (4/17/16 Email, Kushner to Simes (2:44:25 p.m.)); C00006759 (4/14/16 Email \nKushner to Simes & S.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nOn April 25, 2016, Saunders booked event rooms at the Mayflower to host both the speech \nand a VIP reception that was to be held beforehand.619 Saunders understood that the reception\u2014 \nat which invitees would have the chance to meet candidate Trump\u2014would be a small event.620 \nSaunders decided who would attend by looking at the list of CNI\u2019s invitees to the speech itself and \nthen choosing a subset for the reception.621  CNI\u2019s invitees to the reception included Sessions and \nKislyak.622  The week before the speech Simes had informed Kislyak that he would be invited to \nthe speech, and that he would have the opportunity to meet Trump.623 \nWhen the pre-speech reception began on April 27, a receiving line was quickly organized \nso that attendees could meet Trump.624  Sessions first stood next to Trump to introduce him to the \nmembers of Congress who were in attendance.625  After those members had been introduced, \nSimes stood next to Trump and introduced him to the CNI invitees in attendance, including \nKislyak.626 Simes perceived the introduction to be positive and friendly, but thought it clear that \nKislyak and Trump had just met for the first time.627 Kislyak also met Kushner during the pre-\nspeech reception. The two shook hands and chatted for a minute or two, during which Kushner \nrecalled Kislyak saying, \u201cwe like what your candidate is saying . . . it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d628 \nSeveral public reports state that, in addition to speaking to Kushner at the pre-speech \nreception, Kislyak also met or conversed with Sessions at that time.629 \nSessions stated to \ninvestigators, however, that he did not remember any such conversation.630  Nor did anyone else \naffiliated with CNI or the National Interest specifically recall a conversation or meeting between \nSessions and Kislyak at the pre-speech reception.631 It appears that, if a conversation occurred at \nthe pre-speech reception, it was a brief one conducted in public view, similar to the exchange \nbetween Kushner and Kislyak. \n619 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 11-12; C00006651-57 (Mayflower Group Sales Agreement). \n620 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12-13. \n621 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 12. \n622 C00002575 (Attendee List); C00008536 (4/25/16 Email, Simes to Kushner (4:53:45 p.m.)).  \n623 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 19-20. \n624 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \n625 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \n626 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \n627 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21. \n628 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 4.  \n629 See, e.g., Ken Dilanian, Did Trump, Kushner, Sessions Have an Undisclosed Meeting With \nRussian?, NBC News (June 1, 2016); Julia Ioffe, Why Did Jeff Sessions Really Meet With Sergey Kislyak, \nThe Atlantic (June 13, 2017). \n630 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22. \n631 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 21; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 14, 21; Boyd 1/24/18 302, at 3-4; Heilbrunn \n2/1/18 302, at 6; Statement Regarding President Trump\u2019s April 27, 2016 Foreign Policy Speech at the \nCenter for the National Interest, CNI (Mar. 8, 2017). \n106 \n",

Jeff Sessions\u2019s Post-Speech Interactions with CNI \nIn the wake of Sessions\u2019s confirmation hearings as Attorney General, questions arose about \nwhether Sessions\u2019s campaign-period interactions with CNI apart from the Mayflower speech \nincluded any additional meetings with Ambassador Kislyak or involved Russian-related matters.  \nWith respect to Kislyak contacts, on May 23, 2016, Sessions attended CNI\u2019s Distinguished Service \nAward dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C.635 Sessions attended a pre-dinner \nreception and was seated at one of two head tables for the event.636 A seating chart prepared by \nSaunders indicates that Sessions was scheduled to be seated next to Kislyak, who appears to have \nresponded to the invitation by indicating he would attend the event.637 Sessions, however, did not \nremember seeing, speaking with, or sitting next to Kislyak at the dinner.638 Although CNI board \nmember Charles Boyd said he may have seen Kislyak at the dinner,639 Simes, Saunders, and Jacob \nHeilbrunn\u2014editor of the National Interest\u2014all had no recollection of seeing Kislyak at the May \n23 event.640 Kislyak also does not appear in any of the photos from the event that the Office \nobtained. \nIn the summer of 2016, CNI organized at least two dinners in Washington, D.C. for \nSessions to meet with experienced foreign policy professionals.641  The dinners included CNI-\naffiliated individuals, such as Richard Burt and Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador to \nAfghanistan and Iraq and the person who had introduced Trump before the April 27, 2016 foreign-\n632 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 22; Heilbrunn 2/1/18 302, at 7. \n633 Luff 1/30/18 302, at 4. \n634 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 15. \n635 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 22; Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 17.   \n636 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 17; C00004779-80 (5/23/16 Email, Cantelmo to Saunders & Hagberg \n(9:30:12 a.m.); C00004362 (5/23/16 Email, Bauman to Cantelmo et al.

P. 6(e)\npolicy speech.642 Khalilzad also met with Sessions one-on-one separately from the dinners.643  At \nthe dinners and in the meetings, the participants addressed U.S. relations with Russia, including \nhow U.S. relations with NATO and European countries affected U.S. policy toward Russia.644  But \nthe discussions were not exclusively focused on Russia.645 Khalilzad, for example, recalled \ndiscussing \u201cnation-building\u201d and violent extremism with Sessions.646  In addition, Sessions asked \nSaunders (of CNI) to draft two memoranda not specific to Russia: one on Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign \npolicy shortcomings and another on Egypt.647 \nd. Jared Kushner\u2019s Continuing Contacts with Simes \nBetween the April 2016 speech at the Mayflower Hotel and the presidential election, Jared \nKushner had periodic contacts with Simes.648  Those contacts consisted of both in-person meetings \nand phone conversations, which concerned how to address issues relating to Russia in the \nCampaign and how to move forward with the advisory group of foreign policy experts that Simes \nhad proposed.649 Simes recalled that he, not Kushner, initiated all conversations about Russia, and \nthat Kushner never asked him to set up back-channel conversations with Russians.650  According \nto Simes, after the Mayflower speech in late April, Simes raised the issue of Russian contacts with \nKushner, advised that it was bad optics for the Campaign to develop hidden Russian contacts, and \ntold Kushner both that the Campaign should not highlight Russia as an issue and should handle \nany contacts with Russians with care.651 Kushner generally provided a similar account of his \ninteractions with Simes.652 \nAmong the Kushner-Simes meetings was one held on August 17, 2016, at Simes\u2019s request, \nin Kushner\u2019s New York office. The meeting was to address foreign policy advice that CNI was \nproviding and how to respond to the Clinton Campaign\u2019s Russia-related attacks on candidate \n642 Burt 2/9/18 302, at 9-10; Khalilzad 1/9/18 302, at 1-2, 5. \n643 Khalilzad 1/9/18 302, at 5-6.  \n644 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 31; Burt 2/9/18 302, at 9-10; Khalilzad 1/9/18 302, at 5. \n645 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 20. \n646 Khalilzad 1/9/18 302, at 6. \n647 Saunders 2/15/18 302, at 19-20. \n648 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 27. \n649 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 27. \n650 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 27. \n651 Simes 3/8/18 302, at 27.

June 9, 2016 Meeting at Trump Tower  \nOn June 9, 2016, senior representatives of the Trump Campaign met in Trump Tower with \na Russian attorney expecting to receive derogatory information about Hillary Clinton from the \nRussian government. The meeting was proposed to Donald Trump Jr. in an email from Robert \nGoldstone, at the request of his then-client Emin Agalarov, the son of Russian real-estate developer \nAras Agalarov. Goldstone relayed to Trump Jr. that the \u201cCrown prosecutor of Russia . . . offered \nto provide the Trump Campaign with some official documents and information that would \nincriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia\u201d as \u201cpart of Russia and its government\u2019s support \nfor Mr. Trump.\u201d Trump Jr. immediately responded that \u201cif it\u2019s what you say I love it,\u201d and arranged \nthe meeting through a series of emails and telephone calls.  \nTrump Jr. invited campaign chairman Paul Manafort and senior advisor Jared Kushner to \nattend the meeting, and both attended. Members of the Campaign discussed the meeting before it \noccurred, and Michael Cohen recalled that Trump Jr. may have told candidate Trump about an \nupcoming meeting to receive adverse information about Clinton, without linking the meeting to \nRussia. According to written answers submitted by President Trump, he has no recollection of \nlearning of the meeting at the time, and the Office found no documentary evidence showing that he \nwas made aware of the meeting\u2014or its Russian connection\u2014before it occurred. \nThe Russian attorney who spoke at the meeting, Natalia Veselnitskaya, had previously \nworked for the Russian government and maintained a relationship with that government throughout \nthis period of time. She claimed that funds derived from illegal activities in Russia were provided \nto Hillary Clinton and other Democrats. Trump Jr. requested evidence to support those claims, but \nVeselnitskaya did not provide such information. She and her associates then turned to a critique of \nthe origins of the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 statute that imposed financial and travel sanctions on \nRussian officials and that resulted in a retaliatory ban on adoptions of Russian children. Trump Jr. \nsuggested that the issue could be revisited when and if candidate Trump was elected.  After the \nelection, Veselnitskaya made additional efforts to follow up on the meeting, but the Trump \nTransition Team did not engage.         \na. Setting Up the June 9 Meeting  \ni.

According to Gates, Manafort warned the group that the \nmeeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful.705  Hicks denied any \nknowledge of the June 9 meeting before 2017,706 and Kushner did not recall if the planned June 9 \nmeeting came up at all earlier that week.707 \nMichael Cohen recalled being in Donald J.

The Events of June 9, 2016 \ni. Arrangements for the Meeting \nVeselnitskaya was in New York on June 9, 2016, for appellate proceedings in the Prevezon \ncivil forfeiture litigation.714 That day, Veselnitskaya called Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet-born U.S. \nlobbyist, Grand Jury\nand when she learned that he was in New York, invited him \nto lunch.715  Akhmetshin  told the Office  that he  had  worked on  issues relating to the Magnitsky \nAct and had worked on the Prevezon litigation.716   Kaveladze and Anatoli Samochornov,  a \n711 Interview of: Donald J. Trump, Jr., Senate Judiciary Committee, 115th Cong. 28-29, 84, 94-95 \n(Sept. 7, 2017). The Senate Judiciary Committee interview was not under oath, but Trump Jr. was advised \nthat it is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to make materially false statements in a congressional investigation.  \nId. at 10-11. \n712 Manafort 9/11/18 302, at 3-4; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 10. \n713 Written Responses of Donald J. Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 8 (Response to Question I, Parts (a)-\n(c)). We considered whether one sequence of events suggested that candidate Trump had contemporaneous \nknowledge of the June 9 meeting. On June 7, 2016 Trump announced his intention to give \u201ca major speech\u201d \n\u201cprobably Monday of next week\u201d\u2014which would have been June 13\u2014about \u201call of the things that have \ntaken place with the Clintons.\u201d See, e.g., Phillip Bump, What we know about the Trump Tower meeting, \nWashington Post (Aug. 7, 2018). Following the June 9 meeting, Trump changed the subject of his planned \nspeech to national security. But the Office did not find evidence that the original idea for the speech was \nconnected to the anticipated June 9 meeting or that the change of topic was attributable to the failure of that \nmeeting to produce concrete evidence about Clinton. Other events, such as the Pulse nightclub shooting \non June 12, could well have caused the change. The President\u2019s written answers to our questions state that \nthe speech\u2019s focus was altered \u201c[i]n light of\u201d the Pulse nightclub shooting. See Written Responses, supra. \nAs for the original topic of the June 13 speech, Trump has said that \u201che expected to give a speech referencing \nthe publicly available, negative information about the Clintons,\u201d and that the draft of the speech prepared \nby Campaign staff \u201cwas based on publicly available material, including, in particular, information from the \nbook Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer.\u201d Written Responses, supra. In a later June 22 speech, Trump did \nspeak extensively about allegations that Clinton was corrupt, drawing from the Clinton Cash book.

Events at the Republican National Convention   \nTrump Campaign officials met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the week \nof the Republican National Convention.  The evidence indicates that those interactions were brief \nand non-substantive. During platform committee meetings immediately before the Convention, \nJ.D. Gordon, a senior Campaign advisor on policy and national security, diluted a proposed \namendment to the Republican Party platform expressing support for providing \u201clethal\u201d assistance \nto Ukraine in response to Russian aggression. Gordon requested that platform committee \npersonnel revise the proposed amendment to state that only \u201cappropriate\u201d assistance be provided \nto Ukraine. The original sponsor of the \u201clethal\u201d assistance amendment stated that Gordon told her \n(the sponsor) that he was on the phone with candidate Trump in connection with his request to \ndilute the language. \nGordon denied making that statement to the sponsor, although he \nacknowledged it was possible he mentioned having previously spoken to the candidate about the \nsubject matter. The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the \ncandidate to make that proposal. Gordon said that he sought the change because he believed the \nproposed language was inconsistent with Trump\u2019s position on Ukraine.   \na.

P. 6(e)\nfirst meeting to propose amendments.790 \nAlthough only delegates could participate in formal discussions and vote on the platform, \nthe Trump Campaign could request changes, and members of the Trump Campaign attended \ncommittee meetings.791 John Mashburn, the Campaign\u2019s policy director, helped oversee the  \nCampaign\u2019s involvement in the platform committee meetings.792  He told the Office that he  \ndirected Campaign staff at the Convention, including J.D. Gordon, to take a hands-off approach \nand only to challenge platform planks if they directly contradicted Trump\u2019s wishes.793 \nOn July 11, 2016, delegate Diana Denman submitted a proposed platform amendment that \nincluded provision of armed support for Ukraine.794 The amendment described Russia\u2019s \u201congoing \nmilitary aggression\u201d in Ukraine and announced \u201csupport\u201d for \u201cmaintaining (and, if warranted, \nincreasing) sanctions against Russia until Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are fully \nrestored\u201d and for \u201cproviding lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and greater \ncoordination with NATO on defense planning.\u201d795 Gordon reviewed the proposed platform \nchanges, including Denman\u2019s.796 Gordon stated that he flagged this amendment because of \nTrump\u2019s stated position on Ukraine, which Gordon personally heard the candidate say at the March \n31 foreign policy meeting\u2014namely, that the Europeans should take primary responsibility for any \nassistance to Ukraine, that there should be improved U.S.-Russia relations, and that he did not \nwant to start World War III over that region.797 Gordon told the Office that Trump\u2019s statements \non the campaign trail following the March meeting underscored those positions to the point where \nGordon felt obliged to object to the proposed platform change and seek its dilution.798 \nOn July 11, 2016, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Platform \nSubcommittee, Denman offered her amendment.799 Gordon and another Campaign staffer, Matt \nMiller, approached a committee co-chair and asked him to table the amendment to permit further \ndiscussion.800 Gordon\u2019s concern with the amendment was the language about providing \u201clethal \n790 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10; Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 1-2. \n791 Hoff 5/26/17 302, at 1; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 10. \n792 Mashburn 6/25/18 302, at 4; Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 7-8. \n793 Mashburn 6/25/18 302, at 4; Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10. \n794 DENMAN 000001-02, DENMAN 000012, DENMAN 000021-22; Denman 12/4/17 302, at 1; \nDenman 6/7/17 302, at 2. \n795 DENMAN 000001-02, DENMAN 000012, DENMAN 000021-22. \n796 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 10-11. \n797 Gordon 8/29/17 302, at 11; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 11; Gordon 2/14/19 302, at 1-2, 5-6. \n798 Gordon 2/14/19 302, at 5-6. \n799 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 2; see DENMAN 000014. \n800 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 2; Denman 12/4/17 302, at 2; Gordon 9/7/17 302, at 11-12; see Hoff \n5/26/17 302, at 2. \n125 \n",

Gordon stated that he connected with both of them (he \ncould not recall if by phone or in person) and apprised them of the language he took issue with in \nthe proposed amendment. Gordon recalled no objection by either Dearborn or Mashburn and that \nall three Campaign advisors supported the alternative formulation (\u201cappropriate assistance\u201d).809 \nDearborn recalled Gordon warning them about the amendment, but not weighing in because \nGordon was more familiar with the Campaign\u2019s foreign policy stance.810 Mashburn stated that \nGordon reached him, and he told Gordon that Trump had not taken a stance on the issue and that \nthe Campaign should not intervene.811 \nWhen the amendment came up again in the committee\u2019s proceedings, the subcommittee \nchanged the amendment by striking the \u201clethal defense weapons\u201d language and replacing it with \n801 Denman 6/7/17 302, at 3. \n802 M.

Paul Manafort \nPaul Manafort served on the Trump Campaign, including a period as campaign chairman, \nfrom March to August 2016.838   Manafort had connections to Russia through his prior work for \nRussian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and later through his work for a pro-Russian regime in Ukraine.  \nManafort stayed in touch with these contacts during the campaign period through Konstantin \nKilimnik, a longtime Manafort employee who previously ran Manafort\u2019s office in Kiev and who \nthe FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.   \nManafort instructed Rick Gates, his deputy on the Campaign and a longtime employee,839 \nto provide Kilimnik with updates on the Trump Campaign\u2014including internal polling data, \nalthough Manafort claims not to recall that specific instruction. Manafort expected Kilimnik to \nshare that information with others in Ukraine and with Deripaska. Gates periodically sent such \npolling data to Kilimnik during the campaign. \n834 Luff 1/30/18 302, at 6; Landrum 2/27/18 302, at 4-5. \n835 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. \n836 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. \n837 Sessions 1/17/18 302, at 23. \n838 On August 21, 2018, Manafort was convicted in the Eastern District of Virginia on eight tax, \nForeign Bank Account Registration (FBAR), and bank fraud charges. On September 14, 2018, Manafort \npleaded guilty in the District of Columbia to (1) conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to \ncommit offenses against the United States (money laundering, tax fraud, FBAR, Foreign Agents \nRegistration Act (FARA), and FARA false statements), and (2) conspiracy to obstruct justice (witness \ntampering). Manafort also admitted criminal conduct with which he had been charged in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia, but as to which the jury hung. The conduct at issue in both cases involved Manafort\u2019s \nwork in Ukraine and the money he earned for that work, as well as crimes after the Ukraine work ended.  \nOn March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months of imprisonment in the Virginia prosecution. On \nMarch 13, the district court in D.C. sentenced Manafort to a total term of 73 months: 60 months on the \nCount 1 conspiracy (with 30 of those months to run concurrent to the Virginia sentence), and 13 months on \nthe Count 1 conspiracy, to be served consecutive to the other two sentences. The two sentences resulted in \na total term of 90 months. \n839 As noted in Volume I, Section III.D.1.b, supra, Gates pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in \nthe District of Columbia, including making a false statement to the FBI, pursuant to a plea agreement. He \nhas provided information and in-court testimony that the Office has deemed to be reliable. See also \nTranscript at 16, United States v. Paul J. Manafort, Jr., 1:17-cr-201 (D.D.C.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nManafort also twice met Kilimnik in the United States during the campaign period and \nconveyed campaign information. The second meeting took place on August 2, 2016, in New York \nCity. Kilimnik requested the meeting to deliver in person a message from former Ukrainian \nPresident Viktor Yanukovych, who was then living in Russia. The message was about a peace \nplan for Ukraine that Manafort has since acknowledged was a \u201cbackdoor\u201d means for Russia to \ncontrol eastern Ukraine. Several months later, after the presidential election, Kilimnik wrote an \nemail to Manafort expressing the view\u2014which Manafort later said he shared\u2014that the plan\u2019s \nsuccess would require U.S. support to succeed: \u201call that is required to start the process is a very \nminor \u2018wink\u2019 (or slight push) from [Donald Trump].\u201d840 The email also stated that if Manafort \nwere designated as the U.S. representative and started the process, Yanukovych would ensure his \nreception in Russia \u201cat the very top level.\u201d \nManafort communicated with Kilimnik about peace plans for Ukraine on at least four \noccasions after their first discussion of the topic on August 2: December 2016 (the Kilimnik email \ndescribed above); January 2017; February 2017; and again in the spring of 2018. The Office \nreviewed numerous Manafort email and text communications, and asked President Trump about \nthe plan in written questions.841 The investigation did not uncover evidence of Manafort\u2019s passing \nalong information about Ukrainian peace plans to the candidate or anyone else in the Campaign or \nthe Administration. The Office was not, however, able to gain access to all of Manafort\u2019s \nelectronic communications (in some instances, messages were sent using encryption applications).  \nAnd while Manafort denied that he spoke to members of the Trump Campaign or the new \nAdministration about the peace plan, he lied to the Office and the grand jury about the peace plan \nand his meetings with Kilimnik, and his unreliability on this subject was among the reasons that \nthe district judge found that he breached his cooperation agreement.842 \nThe Office could not reliably determine Manafort\u2019s purpose in sharing internal polling data \nwith Kilimnik during the campaign period. Manafort \ndid not see \na downside to sharing campaign information, and told Gates that his role in the Campaign would \nGrand Jury\n840 The email was drafted in Kilimnik\u2019s DMP email account (in English) \nInvestigative Technique\n841 According to the President\u2019s written answers, he does not remember Manafort communicating \nto him any particular positions that Ukraine or Russia would want the United States to support. Written \nResponses of Donald J. Trump (Nov. 20, 2018), at 16-17 (Response to Question IV, Part (d)). \n842 Manafort made several false statements during debriefings. Based on that conduct, the Office \ndetermined that Manafort had breached his plea agreement and could not be a cooperating witness. The \njudge presiding in Manafort\u2019s D.C. criminal case found by a preponderance of the evidence that Manafort \nintentionally made multiple false statements to the FBI, the Office, and the grand jury concerning his \ninteractions and communications with Kilimnik (and concerning two other issues). Although the report \nrefers at times to Manafort\u2019s statements, it does so only when those statements are sufficiently corroborated \nto be trustworthy, to identify issues on which Manafort\u2019s untruthful responses may themselves be of \nevidentiary value, or to provide Manafort\u2019s explanations for certain events, even when we were unable to \ndetermine whether that explanation was credible.   \n130 \n",

As to Deripaska, Manafort claimed that by sharing campaign information with \nhim, Deripaska might see value in their relationship and resolve a \u201cdisagreement\u201d\u2014a reference to \none or more outstanding lawsuits. Because of questions about Manafort\u2019s credibility and our \nlimited ability to gather evidence on what happened to the polling data after it was sent to Kilimnik, \nthe Office could not assess what Kilimnik (or others he may have given it to) did with it. The \nOffice did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort\u2019s sharing polling data and \nRussia\u2019s interference in the election, which had already been reported by U.S. media outlets at the \ntime of the August 2 meeting. The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise \ncoordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts. \na. Paul Manafort\u2019s Ties to Russia and Ukraine \nManafort\u2019s Russian contacts during the campaign and transition periods stem from his \nconsulting work for Deripaska from approximately 2005 to 2009 and his separate political \nconsulting work in Ukraine from 2005 to 2015, including through his company DMP International \nLLC (DMI). Kilimnik worked for Manafort in Kiev during this entire period and continued to \ncommunicate with Manafort through at least June 2018. Kilimnik, who speaks and writes \nUkrainian and Russian, facilitated many of Manafort\u2019s communications with Deripaska and \nUkrainian oligarchs. \ni. \nOleg Deripaska Consulting Work \nIn approximately 2005, Manafort began working for Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who \nhas a global empire involving aluminum and power companies and who is closely aligned with \nVladimir Putin.843 A memorandum describing work that Manafort performed for Deripaska in \n2005 regarding the post-Soviet republics referenced the need to brief the Kremlin and the benefits \nthat the work could confer on \u201cthe Putin Government.\u201d844  Gates described the work Manafort did \nfor Deripaska as \u201cpolitical risk insurance,\u201d and explained that Deripaska used Manafort to install \nfriendly political officials in countries where Deripaska had business interests.845  Manafort\u2019s  \ncompany earned tens of millions of dollars from its work for Deripaska and was loaned millions \nof dollars by Deripaska as well.846 \nIn 2007, Deripaska invested through another entity in Pericles Emerging Market Partners \nL.P. (\u201cPericles\u201d), an investment fund created by Manafort and former Manafort business partner \nRichard Davis. The Pericles fund was established to pursue investments in Eastern Europe.847 \nDeripaska was the sole investor.848  Gates stated in interviews with the Office that the venture led \n843 Pinchuk et al., Russian Tycoon Deripaska in Putin Delegation to China, Reuters (June 8, 2018). \n844 6/23/05 Memo, Manafort & Davis to Deripaska & Rothchild.  \n845 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 7. \n846 Manafort 9/20/18 302, at 2-5; Manafort Income by Year, 2005 \u2013 2015; Manafort Loans from \nWire Transfers, 2005 \u2013 2015. \n847 Gates 3/12/18 302, at 5. \n848 Manafort 12/16/15 Dep., at 157:8-11. \n131 \n",

Manafort assisted the Party of Regions in regaining power, and \nits candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, won the presidency in 2010.

Trump hired him at that time.877 Manafort agreed to work on the \nCampaign without pay. Manafort had no meaningful income at this point in time, but resuscitating \nhis domestic political campaign career could be financially beneficial in the future.

On March 30, 2016, Gates \nemailed the memoranda and a press release announcing Manafort\u2019s appointment to Kilimnik for \ntranslation and dissemination.881 Manafort later followed up with Kilimnik to ensure his messages \nhad been delivered, emailing on April 11, 2016 to ask whether Kilimnik had shown \u201cour friends\u201d \nthe media coverage of his new role.882 Kilimnik replied, \u201cAbsolutely.

Gates stated that, in \naccordance with Manafort\u2019s instruction, he periodically sent Kilimnik polling data via WhatsApp; \nGates then deleted the communications on a daily basis.892  Gates further told the Office that, after \nManafort left the Campaign in mid-August, Gates sent Kilimnik polling data less frequently and \nthat the data he sent was more publicly available information and less internal data.893 \nDeripaska, \nthat he did not know why Manafort wanted him to send polling information, but Gates thought it \nGrand Jury\nGates\u2019s account about polling data is consistent  \n94 \nwith multiple emails that \nGrand Jury\nKilimnik sent to U.S. associates and press contacts between late July and mid-August of 2016.  \nThose emails referenced \u201cinternal polling,\u201d described the status of the Trump Campaign and \n885 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 11; Gates 9/27/18 302 (serial 740), at 2. \n886 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 12. \n887 Gates 2/2/18 302, at 12. \n888 Gates 1/31/18 302, at 17; Gates 9/27/18 302 (serial 740), at 2. In a later interview with the \nOffice, Gates stated that Manafort directed him to send polling data to Kilimnik after a May 7, 2016 meeting \nbetween Manafort and Kilimnik in New York, discussed in Volume I, Section IV.A.8.b.iii, infra.

He \nexplained that, in 2010, he and Yanukovych had lunch to celebrate the recent presidential election.  \nYanukovych gave Manafort a large jar of black caviar that was worth approximately $30,000 to \n$40,000.915 Manafort\u2019s identification of Yanukovych as \u201cthe guy who gave you your biggest black \ncaviar jar\u201d is consistent with Kilimnik being in Moscow\u2014where Yanukovych resided\u2014when \nKilimnik wrote \u201cI met today with the guy,\u201d \nGrand Jury\nand with a December 2016 email in which Kilimnik \nreferred to Yanukovych as \u201cBG,\u201d \n916 Manafort replied to Kilimnik\u2019s July 29 \nemail, \u201cTuesday [August 2] is best . . . Tues or weds in NYC.\u201d917 \nThree days later, on July 31, 2016, Kilimnik flew back to Kiev from Moscow, and on that \nsame day, wrote to Manafort that he needed \u201cabout 2 hours\u201d for their meeting \u201cbecause it is a long \ncaviar story to tell.\u201d918 Kilimnik wrote that he would arrive at JFK on August 2 at 7:30 p.m., and \nhe and Manafort agreed to a late dinner that night.919 Documentary evidence\u2014including flight, \nphone, and hotel records, and the timing of text messages exchanged920\u2014confirms the dinner took \nplace as planned on August 2.921 \nAs to the contents of the meeting itself, the accounts of Manafort and Gates\u2014who arrived \nlate to the dinner\u2014differ in certain respects. But their versions of events, when assessed alongside \navailable documentary evidence and what Kilimnik told business associate Sam Patten, indicate \nthat at least three principal topics were discussed.  \nFirst, Manafort and Kilimnik discussed a plan to resolve the ongoing political problems in \nUkraine by creating an autonomous republic in its more industrialized eastern region of Donbas,922 \n914 7/29/16 Email, Kilimnik to Manafort (10:51 a.m.). \n915 Manafort 9/12/18 302, at 3. \n916 7/29/16 Email, Manafort to Kilimnik; \n; Grand Jury\nInvestigative Technique\n917 7/29/16 Email, Manafort to Kilimnik. \n918 7/31/16 Email, Manafort to Kilimnik. \n919 7/31/16 Email, Manafort to Kilimnik. \n920  Kilimnik 8/2/16 CBP Record; Call Records of Konstantin Kilimnik\n; Call Records of Rick Gates Grand Jury\n; 8/2-3/16, Kilimnik Park Lane Hotel \nReceipt. \n921 Deripaska\u2019s private plane also flew to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on the evening of August \n2, 2016.   According to Customs and Border Protection records, the only passengers on the plane were \nDeripaska\u2019s wife, daughter, mother, and father-in-law, and separate records obtained by our Office confirm \nthat Kilimnik flew on a commercial flight to New York. \n922 The Luhansk and Donetsk People\u2019s Republics, which are located in the Donbas region of \nUkraine, declared themselves independent in response to the popular unrest in 2014 that removed President \nYanukovych from power. Pro-Russian Ukrainian militia forces, with backing from the Russian military, \nhave occupied the region since 2014. Under the Yanukovych-backed plan, Russia would assist in \nwithdrawing the military, and Donbas would become an autonomous region within Ukraine with its own \n139 \n",

Those consisted \nof the unresolved Deripaska lawsuit and the funds that the Opposition Bloc owed to Manafort for \nhis political consulting work and how Manafort might be able to obtain payment.933 \nAfter the meeting, Gates and Manafort both stated that they left separately from Kilimnik \nbecause they knew the media was tracking Manafort and wanted to avoid media reporting on his \nconnections to Kilimnik.934 \nc. Post-Resignation Activities  \nManafort resigned from the Trump Campaign in mid-August 2016, approximately two \nweeks after his second meeting with Kilimnik, amidst negative media reporting about his political \nconsulting work for the pro-Russian Party of Regions in Ukraine. Despite his resignation, \nManafort continued to offer advice to various Campaign officials through the November election.  \nManafort told Gates that he still spoke with Kushner, Bannon, and candidate Trump,935 and some \nof those post-resignation contacts are documented in emails. For example, on October 21, 2016, \nManafort sent Kushner an email and attached a strategy memorandum proposing that the \nCampaign make the case against Clinton \u201cas the failed and corrupt champion of the establishment\u201d \nand that \u201cWikileaks provides the Trump campaign the ability to make the case in a very credible \nway \u2013 by using the words of Clinton, its campaign officials and DNC members.\u201d936  Later, in a \nNovember 5, 2016 email to Kushner entitled \u201cSecuring the Victory,\u201d Manafort stated that he was \n\u201creally feeling good about our prospects on Tuesday and focusing on preserving the victory,\u201d and \nthat he was concerned the Clinton Campaign would respond to a loss by \u201cmov[ing] immediately \nto discredit the [Trump] victory and claim voter fraud and cyber-fraud, including the claim that \nthe Russians have hacked into the voting machines and tampered with the results.\u201d937 \nTrump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Manafort told the Office that, in the \nwake of Trump\u2019s victory, he was not interested in an Administration job. Manafort instead \npreferred to stay on the \u201coutside,\u201d and monetize his campaign position to generate business given \nhis familiarity and relationship with Trump and the incoming Administration.938 \nManafort \nappeared to follow that plan, as he traveled to the Middle East, Cuba, South Korea, Japan, and \nChina and was paid to explain what a Trump presidency would entail.939 \nManafort\u2019s activities in early 2017 included meetings relating to Ukraine and Russia.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nfirst meeting, which took place in Madrid, Spain in January 2017, was with Georgiy Oganov.  \nOganov, who had previously worked at the Russian Embassy in the United States, was a senior \nexecutive at a Deripaska company and was believed to report directly to Deripaska.940 Manafort \ninitially denied attending the meeting. When he later acknowledged it, he claimed that the meeting \nhad been arranged by his lawyers and concerned only the Pericles lawsuit.941 Other evidence, \nhowever, provides reason to doubt Manafort\u2019s statement that the sole topic of the meeting was the \nPericles lawsuit. In particular, text messages to Manafort from a number associated with Kilimnik \nsuggest that Kilimnik and Boyarkin\u2014not Manafort\u2019s counsel\u2014had arranged the meeting between \nManafort and Oganov.942 Kilimnik\u2019s message states that the meeting was supposed to be \u201cnot \nabout money or Pericles\u201d but instead \u201cabout recreating [the] old friendship\u201d\u2014ostensibly between \nManafort and Deripaska\u2014\u201cand talking about global politics.\u201d943  Manafort also replied by text that \nhe \u201cneed[s] this finished before Jan. 20,\u201d944 which appears to be a reference to resolving Pericles \nbefore the inauguration. \nOn January 15, 2017, three days after his return from Madrid, Manafort emailed K.T. \nMcFarland, who was at that time designated to be Deputy National Security Advisor and was \nformally appointed to that position on January 20, 2017.945 Manafort\u2019s January 15 email to \nMcFarland stated: \u201cI have some important information I want to share that I picked up on my \ntravels over the last month.\u201d946  Manafort told the Office that the email referred to an issue  \nregarding Cuba, not Russia or Ukraine, and Manafort had traveled to Cuba in the past month.947 \nEither way, McFarland\u2014who was advised by Flynn not to respond to the Manafort inquiry\u2014 \nappears not to have responded to Manafort.948 \nManafort told the Office that around the time of the Presidential Inauguration in January, \nhe met with Kilimnik and Ukrainian oligarch Serhiy Lyovochkin at the Westin Hotel in \nAlexandria, Virginia.949 During this meeting, Kilimnik again discussed the Yanukovych peace \nplan that he had broached at the August 2 meeting and in a detailed December 8, 2016 message \nfound in Kilimnik\u2019s DMP email account.950 \nIn that December 8 email, which Manafort \n940 Kalashnikova 5/17/18 302, at 4; Gary Lee, Soviet Embassy\u2019s Identity Crisis, Washington Post \n(Dec. 20, 1991); Georgy S.

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nThose contacts included matters pertaining to the criminal charges brought by the Office,959 and \nthe Ukraine peace plan. In early 2018, Manafort retained his longtime polling firm to craft a draft \npoll in Ukraine, sent the pollsters a three-page primer on the plan sent by Kilimnik, and worked \nwith Kilimnik to formulate the polling questions.960  The primer sent to the pollsters specifically \ncalled for the United States and President Trump to support the Autonomous Republic of Donbas \nwith Yanukovych as Prime Minister,961 and a series of questions in the draft poll asked for opinions \non Yanukovych\u2019s role in resolving the conflict in Donbas.962 (The poll was not solely about \nDonbas; it also sought participants\u2019 views on leaders apart from Yanukovych as they pertained to \nthe 2019 Ukraine presidential election.) \nThe Office has not uncovered evidence that Manafort brought the Ukraine peace plan to \nthe attention of the Trump Campaign or the Trump Administration. Kilimnik continued his efforts \nto promote the peace plan to the Executive Branch (e.g., U.S. Department of State) into the summer \nof 2018.963 \nB. Post-Election and Transition-Period Contacts   \nTrump was elected President on November 8, 2016. Beginning immediately after the \nelection, individuals connected to the Russian government started contacting officials on the \nTrump Campaign and Transition Team through multiple channels\u2014sometimes through Russian \nAmbassador Kislyak and at other times through individuals who sought reliable contacts through \nU.S. persons not formally tied to the Campaign or Transition Team. The most senior levels of the \nRussian government encouraged these efforts. The investigation did not establish that these efforts \nreflected or constituted coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia in its election-\ninterference activities. \n1. Immediate Post-Election Activity \nAs soon as news broke that Trump had been elected President, Russian government \nofficials and prominent Russian businessmen began trying to make inroads into the new \nAdministration. They appeared not to have preexisting contacts and struggled to connect with \nsenior officials around the President-Elect. As explained below, those efforts entailed both official \ncontact through the Russian Embassy in the United States and outreaches\u2014sanctioned at high \nlevels of the Russian government\u2014through business rather than political contacts.   \n959 Manafort (D.D.C.)

Outreach from the Russian Government \nAt approximately 3 a.m. on election night, Trump Campaign press secretary Hope Hicks \nreceived a telephone call on her personal cell phone from a person who sounded foreign but was \ncalling from a number with a DC area code.964 Although Hicks had a hard time understanding the \nperson, she could make out the words \u201cPutin call.\u201d965 Hicks told the caller to send her an email.966 \nThe following morning, on November 9, 2016, Sergey Kuznetsov, an official at the Russian \nEmbassy to the United States, emailed Hicks from his Gmail address with the subject line,  \n\u201cMessage from Putin.\u201d967 Attached to the email was a message from Putin, in both English and \nRussian, which Kuznetsov asked Hicks to convey to the President-Elect.968  In the message, Putin \noffered his congratulations to Trump for his electoral victory, stating he \u201clook[ed] forward to \nworking with [Trump] on leading Russian-American relations out of crisis.\u201d969 \nHicks forwarded the email to Kushner, asking, \u201cCan you look into this?

High-Level Encouragement of Contacts through Alternative Channels \nAs Russian officials in the United States reached out to the President-Elect and his team, a \nnumber of Russian individuals working in the private sector began their own efforts to make \ncontact. Petr Aven, a Russian national who heads Alfa-Bank, Russia\u2019s largest commercial bank, \ndescribed to the Office interactions with Putin during this time period that might account for the \nflurry of Russian activity.976 \nAven told the Office that he is one of approximately 50 wealthy Russian businessmen who \nregularly meet with Putin in the Kremlin; these 50 men are often referred to as \u201coligarchs.\u201d977 \nAven told the Office that he met on a quarterly basis with Putin, including in the fourth quarter \n(Q4) of 2016, shortly after the U.S. presidential election.978 Aven said that he took these meetings \nseriously and understood that any suggestions or critiques that Putin made during these meetings \nwere implicit directives, and that there would be consequences for Aven if he did not follow \nthrough.979 As was typical, the 2016 Q4 meeting with Putin was preceded by a preparatory meeting \nwith Putin\u2019s chief of staff, Anton Vaino.980 \nAccording to Aven, at his Q4 2016 one-on-one meeting with Putin,981 Putin raised the \nprospect that the United States would impose additional sanctions on Russian interests, including \nsanctions against Aven and/or Alfa-Bank.982 Putin suggested that Aven needed to take steps to \nprotect himself and Alfa-Bank.983 Aven also testified that Putin spoke of the difficulty faced by \nthe Russian government in getting in touch with the incoming Trump Administration.984 \nAccording to Aven, Putin indicated that he did not know with whom formally to speak and \ngenerally did not know the people around the President-Elect.985 \nGrand Jury\n976 Aven provided information to the Office in an interview and through an attorney proffer, \n977 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 7. \n978 Grand Jury\n979 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 2-3. \n980 \nand interview with the Office, \nAven referred to the high-ranking Russian government officials using numbers (e.g., Official 1, Official 2). \nGrand Jury\nAven separately confirmed through an attorney proffer that Official 1 was Putin and Official 2 was Putin\u2019s \nchief of staff, Vaino. See Affidavit of Ryan Junck (Aug. 2, 2018) (hard copy on file). \n981 At the time of his Q4 2016 meeting with Putin, Aven was generally aware of the press coverage \nabout Russian interference in the U.S. election. According to Aven, he did not discuss that topic with Putin \nat any point, and Putin did not mention the rationale behind the threat of new sanctions.

Kirill Dmitriev\u2019s Transition-Era Outreach to the Incoming Administration \nAven\u2019s description of his interactions with Putin is consistent with the behavior of Kirill \nDmitriev, a Russian national who heads Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and is closely connected \nto Putin. Dmitriev undertook efforts to meet members of the incoming Trump Administration in \nthe months after the election. Dmitriev asked a close business associate who worked for the United \nArab Emirates (UAE) royal court, George Nader, to introduce him to Trump transition officials, \nand Nader eventually arranged a meeting in the Seychelles between Dmitriev and Erik Prince, a \nTrump Campaign supporter and an associate of Steve Bannon.989 In addition, the UAE national \nsecurity advisor introduced Dmitriev to a hedge fund manager and friend of Jared Kushner, Rick \nGerson, in late November 2016. In December 2016 and January 2017, Dmitriev and Gerson \nworked on a proposal for reconciliation between the United States and Russia, which Dmitriev \nimplied he cleared through Putin. \nGerson provided that proposal to Kushner before the \ninauguration, and Kushner later gave copies to Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.   \na. Background \nDmitriev is a Russian national who was appointed CEO of Russia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, \nthe Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), when it was founded in 2011.990 Dmitriev reported \ndirectly to Putin and frequently referred to Putin as his \u201cboss.\u201d991 \nRDIF has co-invested in various projects with UAE sovereign wealth funds.992 Dmitriev \nregularly interacted with Nader, a senior advisor to UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed \n \n986 Grand Jury\n987 \n Aven 8/2/18 302,  at 6. \nGrand Jury\n988 Aven 8/2/18  302, at 4-8; Grand Jury\n989 Nader provided information to the Office in multiple interviews, all but one of which were \nconducted under a  proffer agreementGrand Jury\n, \n.

He noted in a text message to Gerson \nthat if Russia was \u201capproached with respect and willingness to understand our position, we can \nhave Major Breakthroughs quickly.\u201d1105 Gerson and Dmitriev exchanged ideas in December 2016 \nabout what such a reconciliation plan would include.1106 Gerson told the Office that the Transition \nTeam had not asked him to engage in these discussions with Dmitriev, and that he did so on his \nown initiative and as a private citizen.1107 \nOn January 9, 2017, the same day he asked Nader whether meeting Prince would be \nworthwhile, Dmitriev sent his biography to Gerson and asked him if he could \u201cshare it with Jared \n(or somebody else very senior in the team) \u2013 so that they know that we are focused from our side \non improving the relationship and my boss asked me to play a key role in that.\u201d1108 Dmitriev also \nasked Gerson if he knew Prince, and if Prince was somebody important or worth spending time \n1099 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 1. \n1100 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 1-2; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 21. \n1101 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3-4; see, e.g., 12/2/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev & Gerson; 12/14/16 Text \nMessages, Dmitriev & Gerson; 1/3/17 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev; 12/2/16 Email, Tolokonnikov to \nGerson. \n1102 Gerson 6/5/18 302, at 3; 12/14/16 Text Message, Dmitriev to Gerson. \n1103 12/14/16 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev. \n1104 12/14/16 Text Message, Gerson to Dmitriev. \n1105 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev & Gerson; Gerson 6/15/18 302, at 1. \n1106 12/14/16 Text Messages, Dmitriev & Gerson. \n1107 Gerson 6/15/18 302, at 1. \n1108 1/9/17 Text Messages, Dmitriev to Gerson; 1/9/17 Text Message, Dmitriev to Nader.          \n157 \n",

R. Crim. P. 6(e)\nForesman, at the end of an early December 2016 meeting with incoming National Security Advisor \nMichael Flynn and his designated deputy (K.T. McFarland) in New York, Flynn asked Foresman \nfor his thoughts on Kislyak. Foresman had not met Kislyak but told Flynn that, while Kislyak was \nan important person, Kislyak did not have a direct line to Putin.1132 Foresman subsequently \ntraveled to Moscow, inquired of a source he believed to be close to Putin, and heard back from \nthat source that Ushakov would be the official channel for the incoming U.S. national security \nadvisor.1133 Foresman acknowledged that Flynn had not asked him to undertake that inquiry in \nRussia but told the Office that he nonetheless felt obligated to report the information back to Flynn, \nand that he worked to get a face-to-face meeting with Flynn in January 2017 so that he could do \nso.1134 Email correspondence suggests that the meeting ultimately went forward,1135 but Flynn has \nno recollection of it or of the earlier December meeting.1136 (The investigation did not identify \nevidence of Flynn or Kushner meeting with Ushakov after being given his name.1137) \nIn the meantime, although he had already formed the impression that Kislyak was not \nnecessarily the right point of contact,1138 Kushner went forward with the meeting that Kislyak had \nrequested on November 16. It took place at Trump Tower on November 30, 2016.1139  At  \nKushner\u2019s invitation, Flynn also attended; Bannon was invited but did not attend.1140 During the \nmeeting, which lasted approximately 30 minutes, Kushner expressed a desire on the part of the \nincoming Administration to start afresh with U.S.-Russian relations.1141  Kushner  also asked  \nKislyak to identify the best person (whether Kislyak or someone else) with whom to direct future \ndiscussions\u2014someone who had contact with Putin and the ability to speak for him.1142 \nThe three men also discussed U.S. policy toward Syria, and Kislyak floated the idea of \nhaving Russian generals brief the Transition Team on the topic using a secure communications \nline.1143 After Flynn explained that there was no secure line in the Transition Team offices, \n1132 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 17. \n1133 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 17-18. \n1134 Foresman 10/17/18 302, at 18. \n1135 RMF-SCO-00000015 (1/5/17 Email, Foresman to Atencio & Flaherty); RMF-SCO-00000015 \n(1/5/17 Email, Flaherty to Foresman & Atencio).  \n1136 9/26/18 Attorney Proffer from Covington & Burling LLP (reflected in email on file with the \nOffice). \n1137 Vargas 4/4/18 302, at 5. \n1138 Kushner 11/1/17 302, at 4. \n1139 AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ_0000016-019 (11/29/16 Email, Vargas to Kuznetsov). \n1140 Flynn 1/11/18 302, at 2; NOS00004240 (Calendar Invite, Vargas to Kushner & Flynn). \n1141 Kushner Stmt. at 6. \n1142 Kushner Stmt. at 6; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18. \n1143 Kushner Stmt. at 7; Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 18; Flynn 1/11/18 302, at 2. \n160 \n",

Kushner told the Office that the meeting was diplomatic, with Gorkov \nexpressing disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for \nimproved relations with the incoming Administration.1157 According to Kushner, although Gorkov \ntold Kushner a little bit about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy, the \ntwo did not discuss Kushner\u2019s companies or private business dealings of any kind.1158  (At the time \nof the meeting, Kushner Companies had a debt obligation coming due on the building it owned at \n666 Fifth Avenue, and there had been public reporting both about efforts to secure lending on the \nproperty and possible conflicts of interest for Kushner arising out of his company\u2019s borrowing \nfrom foreign lenders.1159) \nIn contrast, in a 2017 public statement, VEB suggested Gorkov met with Kushner in  \nKushner\u2019s capacity as CEO of Kushner Companies for the purpose of discussing business, rather \nthan as part of a diplomatic effort. In particular, VEB characterized Gorkov\u2019s meeting with \nKushner as part of a series of \u201croadshow meetings\u201d with \u201crepresentatives of major US banks and \nbusiness circles,\u201d which included \u201cnegotiations\u201d and discussion of the \u201cmost promising business \nlines and sectors.\u201d1160 \nForesman, the investment bank executive mentioned in Volume I, Sections IV.A.1 and \nIV.B.3, supra, told the Office that he met with Gorkov and VEB deputy chairman Nikolay \nTsekhomsky in Moscow just before Gorkov left for New York to meet Kushner.1161 According to \nForesman, Gorkov and Tsekhomsky told him that they were traveling to New York to discuss post-\nelection issues with U.S. financial institutions, that their trip was sanctioned by Putin, and that they \nwould be reporting back to Putin upon their return.1162 \n1155 Kushner 4/11/18 302, at 19.

Regardless, the investigation did not identify evidence that Kushner \nand Gorkov engaged in any substantive follow-up after the meeting.   \nRather, a few days after the meeting, Gorkov\u2019s assistant texted Kushner\u2019s assistant, \u201cHi, \nplease inform your side that the information about the meeting had a very positive response!\u201d1163 \nOver the following weeks, the two assistants exchanged a handful of additional cordial texts.1164 \nOn February 8, 2017, Gorkov\u2019s assistant texted Kushner\u2019s assistant (Berkowitz) to try to set up \nanother meeting, and followed up by text at least twice in the days that followed.1165 According \nto Berkowitz, he did not respond to the meeting request in light of the press coverage regarding \nthe Russia investigation, and did not tell Kushner about the meeting request.1166 \n5. Petr Aven\u2019s Outreach Efforts to the Transition Team \nIn December 2016, weeks after the one-on-one meeting with Putin described in Volume I, \nSection IV.B.1.b, supra, Petr Aven attended what he described as a separate \u201call-hands\u201d oligarch \nmeeting between Putin and Russia\u2019s most prominent businessmen.1167 As in Aven\u2019s one-on-one \nmeeting, a main topic of discussion at the oligarch meeting in December 2016 was the prospect of \nforthcoming U.S. economic sanctions.1168 \nAfter the December 2016 all-hands meeting, Aven tried to establish a connection to the \nTrump team. \nAven instructed Richard Burt to make contact with the incoming Trump \nAdministration. Burt was on the board of directors for LetterOne (L1), another company headed \nby Aven, and had done work for Alfa-Bank.1169 Burt had previously served as U.S. ambassador \nto Germany and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, and one of his \nprimary roles with Alfa-Bank and L1 was to facilitate introductions to business contacts in the \nUnited States and other Western countries.1170 \nWhile at a L1 board meeting held in Luxembourg in late December 2016, Aven pulled Burt \naside and told him that he had spoken to someone high in the Russian government who expressed \n1163 AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ_0000011 (12/19/16 Text Message, Ivanchenko to Berkowitz \n(9:56 a.m.)). \n1164 AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ_0000011-15 (12/19/16 \u2013 2/16/17 Text Messages, Ivanchenko \n& Berkowitz). \n1165 AKIN_GUMP_BERKOWITZ_0000015 (2/8/17 Text Message, Ivanchenko to Berkowitz \n(10:41 a.m.)). \n1166 Berkowitz 3/22/18 302, at 4-5. \n1167 Aven 8/2/18 302, at 7; \n1168 \n1169\n Aven 8/2/18 302, at 6. \n1170\n Aven 8/2/18 302, at 6; Burt 2/9/18 302, at 2. \nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\n163 \n",

There is an interest and an understanding for the \nneed to establish such a channel.  But the individual emphasized that at this moment, with \nso much intense interest in the Congress and the media over the question of cyber-hacking \n(and who ordered what), Project A was too explosive to discuss.  The individual agreed to \ndiscuss it again after the New Year.

Contacts With and Through Michael T. Flynn  \nIncoming National Security Advisor Michael Flynn was the Transition Team\u2019s primary \nconduit for communications with the Russian Ambassador and dealt with Russia on two sensitive \nmatters during the transition period: a United Nations Security Council vote and the Russian \ngovernment\u2019s reaction to the United States\u2019s imposition of sanctions for Russian interference in \nthe 2016 election.1207 Despite Kushner\u2019s conclusion that Kislyak did not wield influence inside \nthe Russian government, the Transition Team turned to Flynn\u2019s relationship with Kislyak on \nboth issues. As to the sanctions, Flynn spoke by phone to K.T. McFarland, his incoming deputy, \nto prepare for his call to Kislyak; McFarland was with the President-Elect and other senior \nmembers of the Transition Team at Mar-a-Lago at the time.  Although transition officials at Mar-\na-Lago had some concern about possible Russian reactions to the sanctions, the investigation did \nnot identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak. Flynn \nasked Kislyak not to escalate the situation in response to U.S. sanctions imposed on December 29, \n2016, and Kislyak later reported to Flynn that Russia acceded to that request.   \na. United Nations Vote on Israeli Settlements \nOn December 21, 2016, Egypt submitted a resolution to the United Nations Security \nCouncil calling on Israel to cease settlement activities in Palestinian territory.1208 The Security \nCouncil, which includes Russia, was scheduled to vote on the resolution the following day.1209 \nThere was speculation in the media that the Obama Administration would not oppose the \nresolution.1210 \n1204 \n1205 \n1206 \nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\nGrand Jury\n1207 As discussed further in Volume I, Section V.C.4, infra, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false \nstatements to the FBI, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, about these communications with Ambassador \nKislyak.
